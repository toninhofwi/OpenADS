// per connection. Each accepted socket is assigned to exactly one worker
// for its whole lifetime (submit -> that worker's poll set), so the ADS
// ABI handles a connection owns are only ever touched by a single thread
// (the same thread-affinity guarantee the legacy thread-per-connection
// path had). Thread count stays bounded at the worker count regardless of
// how many connections are open; idle connections cost one fd in a poll
// set, not a thread + stack.
