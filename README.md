# OpenADS

A free and open-source implementation compatible with Advantage Database Server (ADS), discontinued by SAP.

The goal is to provide a *drop-in* replacement for the Advantage Client Engine (`ace32.dll` / `ace64.dll` / `libace.so`) so existing applications — particularly Harbour/Clipper apps using `contrib/rddads` — keep working without recompilation.

### Independence, provenance, and trademarks

- **Independent implementation.** OpenADS is an independent
  open-source project. It is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or
  endorsed by SAP SE. "Advantage Database Server", "ADS", and any
  related marks, logos, and product names are the property of their
  respective owners and are referenced here solely to describe
  compatibility — their use does not imply any affiliation or
  endorsement.
- **No SAP-owned binaries required.** The OpenADS DLL is a
  drop-in replacement; running an application against
  `ace32.dll` / `ace64.dll` / `libace.so` produced by this project
  does **not** require any DLL, `.so`, or other binary owned by SAP.
  The only runtime dependencies are the host operating system's
  standard libraries (e.g. `KERNEL32.dll` and the Microsoft Visual
  C++ / Universal CRT runtime on Windows; `libc` / `libstdc++` on
  Linux).
- **Provenance — clean-room.** This codebase is written from
  publicly observable behavior of the original Advantage Client
  Engine and from the **public** Harbour `contrib/rddads` source
  (which is the call site OpenADS targets). It is **not** derived
  from leaked internal manuals or from disassembly / reverse
  engineering of SAP-owned binaries that would violate the
  Advantage SDK / ACE EULA. The implementation has been generated
  by an AI assistant (Anthropic Claude) under direct human
  supervision; every milestone is reviewed, tested, and committed
  by a human maintainer.
- **Purpose — non-commercial preservation.** OpenADS is a
  community-driven open-source project pursued **without economic
  benefit to its maintainers**. Its only goal is to provide a
  compatibility path for legacy applications affected by SAP's
  discontinuation of Advantage Database Server, so the existing
  Harbour / Clipper code base that depends on the ACE entry points
  can keep running. The project does not sell, license, sublicense,
  or otherwise monetise the software; redistribution is permitted
  by the Apache License 2.0 (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)) but the
  upstream maintainers receive no fee for the work.
- **No warranty, no support contract.** OpenADS is provided **AS
  IS**, without warranty of any kind, express or implied (see the
  Apache License 2.0 §7 and §8). There is no service-level
  agreement, no commercial support channel, and no representation
  of fitness for any particular purpose.
- **Downstream responsibility.** Users who deploy OpenADS as a
  drop-in replacement for the Advantage Client Engine remain solely
  responsible for ensuring that **their own** use of related
  third-party tooling (Harbour, Clipper, original Advantage
  installations, application code, fixtures) complies with whatever
  licenses, EULAs, or service agreements apply to those components.
  The project ships no SAP-owned binary and asserts no permission
  on behalf of any third-party rightsholder.

## Status

**0.3.3 released** (2026-05-06). Phase 2 TCP server is alive end-
to-end — `tools/serverd/openads_serverd` exposes the engine over a
length-prefixed wire protocol; `AdsConnect60("tcp://host:port/dir",
...)` opens the same `ace64.dll` against a remote server (M12.3 +
M12.4 + M12.5). A 13-op cross-host smoke (`Hello → Connect →
OpenTable → GetRecordCount → GotoTop → GetField → Skip →
Disconnect`) round-trips Windows-side → Linux server through an
SSH-forwarded TCP channel. Adds `tools/bench/openads_bench`, a
cross-platform SQL workload timer that compares Windows MSVC,
Linux clang -O3 and macOS AppleClang on the same source tree (see
the **Performance** section above). Linux + macOS builds are now
clang -Werror clean; macOS-specific platform fixes (HOST_NAME_MAX,
self-connect accept wake, OFD-vs-classic fcntl locks) landed.

Earlier: **0.3.0** (2026-05-05) — 42 M10.x SQL milestones + 3 M11.x
non-SQL milestones (V/Q field types, AEP host, OpenADS-encrypted
DBF) merged on top of 0.2.0. The full Harbour-reachable `Ads*` ABI
surface is MISS-free; the SQL surface covers the practical
Advantage SQL dialect end-to-end.

Earlier: 0.2.0 (2026-05-04) — 27 M9.x milestones on top of 0.1.0,
unlocked the full `Ads*` ABI.

A real Harbour application, compiled against the standard
`contrib/rddads` static library, opens a DBF, walks records, runs
`dbSeek`, **swaps focus across multiple CDX tags**, **runs ARIES
transactions** with rollback semantics, **reads and writes memo
fields**, **creates tables / indexes dynamically**, **packs and
zaps tables**, **reindexes from a compound key expression**, and
reopens to verify durability — every call lands on OpenADS'
`ace64.dll` with no Harbour rebuild. See
`tests/harbour_smoke/README.md` for the captured output of every
M8.x / M9.x milestone.

### Quick start

Building OpenADS produces `ace64.dll` (or `ace32.dll` on x86; on
POSIX, `libace.so` / `libace.dylib`):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FiveTechSoft/OpenADS
cd OpenADS
cmake --preset default
cmake --build build/default --config Release
ctest --test-dir build/default --output-on-failure -C Release
```

Drop the resulting `ace64.dll` (under
`build/default/src/Release/`) onto a Harbour app's `PATH` ahead of
any SAP-shipped copy and the standard `contrib/rddads` calls land
on OpenADS without recompiling Harbour.

### Performance — cross-platform SQL bench

`tools/bench/openads_bench` generates a synthetic 100 000-row DBF
(`ID N(8,0)`, `TAG C(4)`, `AMT N(8,2)`) and times a fixed set of
SQL workloads through the public ABI (`AdsExecuteSQLDirect`).
Median of 5 repeats per workload, all-Release builds:

| Workload (median ms)   | Windows MSVC | Linux clang -O3 | macOS AppleClang |
|------------------------|-------------:|----------------:|-----------------:|
| stage 100 k-row DBF    |        63.5  |          57.9   |           34.0   |
| `SELECT COUNT(*)`      |       297.7  |          42.0   |          103.9   |
| `WHERE TAG = 'AAAA'`   |       303.7  |          48.3   |          108.4   |
| `SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX(AMT)` |       374.3  |         120.5   |          136.1   |
| `GROUP BY TAG`         |       321.9  |          58.6   |          120.9   |
| `ORDER BY AMT LIMIT 10`|       668.0  |         165.4   |          260.5   |
| `DISTINCT TAG`         |       598.4  |          95.2   |          213.4   |
| `BETWEEN 100 AND 500`  |       314.1  |          63.7   |          114.4   |

Same source tree, same workload, three OS / toolchain combinations.
Linux clang -O3 wins every SQL workload — roughly 7× faster than
MSVC Release on the full-table count, 4× on the heavier `ORDER BY`.
macOS Intel sits between the two. Run it on your own hardware:

```sh
cmake --build build/default --target openads_bench
./build/default/tools/bench/openads_bench --rows 100000 --repeats 5 --csv
```

A working **TCP server (`tools/serverd/openads_serverd`) + dual-mode
client (`tcp://host:port/dir` URI in `AdsConnect60`)** is already in
the tree (M12.x, Phase 2). Cross-host smoke: 13-op session
(`Hello → Connect → OpenTable → GetRecordCount → GotoTop →
GetField → Skip → Disconnect`) round-trips end-to-end through a
Windows-side client → remote Linux server over an SSH-forwarded
TCP channel; ~9 ms server-side per op, the rest is real WAN RTT.

### What works today (0.2.0)

#### Engine

- **DBF read/write** — C / N / L / D / M columns, positional and
  by-name field access, `APPEND BLANK`, per-field assignment,
  deletion flag, durable flush, dynamic table creation
  (`AdsCreateTable` parses rddads' `NAME,Type,Len,Dec;…` field-def
  syntax).
- **DBF maintenance** — `AdsZapTable` empties a DBF + clears every
  bound index in lockstep; `AdsPackTable` compacts deleted records
  out of the DBF (Clipper semantics: leaves indexes stale, caller
  follows up with `AdsReindex`); `AdsReindex` rebuilds every bound
  index from the current records using each tag's expression.
- **CDX index** — full FoxPro compound layout (file header at offset
  0 holding the structure tag, sub-tag headers, per-tag B+tree),
  multi-tag-per-file API (`add_tag` / `open_named` / `list_tags`),
  Harbour-equivalent compact-leaf bit-pack (`bBits` derived from key
  length, mirroring `hb_cdxPageLeafInitSpace`), B+tree leaf splits
  with separator promotion, branch descent (BE child pointers),
  `dbSeek` exact + soft, `dbGoTop` / `dbSkip` walks, auto-sync on
  every mutation across **all** bound tags (active + parked extras),
  dynamic creation via `AdsCreateIndex61`.
- **NTX index** — Clipper layout, multi-level B+tree split (M9.10
  closed the M3.7 single-level limitation), cache-based in-order
  traversal for `next` / `prev` over multi-level trees, dynamic
  creation via `AdsCreateIndex61`, multi-file binding (M9.14 — apps
  can bundle several `.ntx` files on a single `USE` and swap focus
  between them without losing the parked tags' write sync).
- **Compound key expressions** — `UPPER(field)`, `LOWER(field)`,
  `LTRIM` / `RTRIM` / `ALLTRIM`, `STR(n)` / `STR(n,len)` /
  `STR(n,len,dec)`, `DTOS(date)`, `SUBSTR(s,start[,len])`,
  string concatenation with `+`. `UPPER` / `LOWER` / `SUBSTR` walk
  UTF-8 codepoints (ASCII + Latin-1 supplement case map, including
  `ÿ↔Ÿ`); the evaluator runs at index sync time, so an
  `INDEX ON UPPER(name)` tag normalises every key as the app writes
  records, including non-ASCII rows produced by `AdsSetStringW`.
- **Full-text search** — `AdsCreateFTSIndex` writes a clean-room
  `# OpenADS FTS v0` text file (sorted token + recno-list per row);
  `AdsFTSSearch` and the SQL `CONTAINS(<col>, '<query>')` predicate
  intersect per-token recno lists with AND semantics. Tokeniser
  honours `ulMinWordLen` / `ulMaxWordLen`, custom delimiter +
  noise-word arrays, and an English stop-word seed.
- **WAL recovery** — append-only log with CRC-32C records,
  group-commit primitive (`sync_to(lsn)`), per-record LSN, idempotent
  recovery via the `openads.lsnmap` sidecar.
- **Transactions (TPS)** — `AdsBeginTransaction` / `AdsCommitTransaction`
  / `AdsRollbackTransaction`, in-memory ordered op log + named
  savepoints, multi-table commit, rollback marks appended records as
  deleted (Clipper convention) and writes back before-images for
  modified rows.
- **AES-128 / AES-256 ECB** — vendored tiny-AES-c (Unlicense),
  validated against FIPS-197 + NIST SP 800-38A.
- **Memo (DBT / FPT)** — read + write round-trip;
  `Connection::open_table` auto-attaches the right memo store based on
  the DBF signature (`0x03` → no memo, `0x30` → CDX with FPT memo).
  FPT blocks carry an explicit type tag (Text / Picture / Object), so
  the same field can hold either text memos or `ADS_BINARY` /
  `ADS_IMAGE` payloads with embedded NULs.
- **Data Dictionary** — `.add` alias resolution; `Connection::open(<.add>)`
  resolves member tables on every `AdsOpenTable`.
- **Locking** — OS byte-range locks with the same ranges as the
  original ACE so installs can coexist during migration. Lock
  acquires are non-blocking (`LockFileEx LOCKFILE_FAIL_IMMEDIATELY`
  on Windows, `fcntl F_SETLK` on POSIX) and re-attempt up to a
  configurable retry budget (`AdsSetLockCycle` /
  `AdsSetLockRetryCount`, defaults 100 ms / 10 retries).

#### ABI

- **231 `Ads*` exports** — every entry point Harbour
  `c:\harbour\lib\win\msvc64\rddads.lib` references is resolvable
  through OpenADS' DLL. Real implementations for ~ 130 of them; the
  remainder are **local-mode silent-success** (the `AdsMg*`
  server-management surface, the `AdsDD*` advanced-DD CRUD surface,
  and the `Cache*` / `Set*` / `Refresh*` / `Customize*` Harbour-side
  preferences — all return `AE_SUCCESS` and either zero-fill the
  caller's struct or report empty / quiescent state, so apps that
  only inspect the return code keep running). **No exports
  hard-fail with `AE_FUNCTION_NOT_AVAILABLE` at the function level
  any more.** Specific ADD-only branches (e.g.
  `AdsRestructureTable`'s `pucDeleteFields` / `pucChangeFields`
  arguments) still surface that error code at the argument level
  with a clear comment pointing at the 0.3.x deferral. The split
  is documented inline in `src/abi/ace_stubs.cpp`.
- **6 legacy CRT shims** — `_dclass`, `_dsign`, `_wfsopen`, `_getch`,
  `_kbhit`, `_eof` re-exported from `ace64.dll` so apps built against
  Harbour's prebuilt MSVC2013-era libs link without rebuilding
  Harbour itself.

#### SQL

- **DML.** `INSERT INTO <t> (cols) VALUES (lits)` (M10.5),
  `UPDATE <t> SET col=lit, … [WHERE …]` (M10.7), and
  `DELETE FROM <t> [WHERE …]` (M10.7) all flow through
  `AdsExecuteSQLDirect`; the dispatcher peeks at the leading
  keyword and routes to the right path.
- **SELECT.** `SELECT * FROM <table> [WHERE <expr>] [ORDER BY <col>
  [ASC|DESC]]` where `<expr>` is a full boolean tree built from
  `AND` / `OR` / `NOT` / parens (M10.3) over leaves that are either
  an infix comparison `<col> op <lit>` (six operators: `=`, `!=` /
  `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`; literal can be a string `'…'` or a
  numeric `42` / `3.14`) or `CONTAINS(<col>, '<query>')` against a
  prebuilt `.fts` file. ORDER BY (M10.6) materialises matching
  recnos and sorts by the column's typed value. CONTAINS captures
  a precomputed recno-set so the FTS lookup runs once per query,
  not per row. Projection lists, joins, aggregates, subqueries,
  `CREATE TABLE` / `CREATE INDEX` arrive in later 0.3.x milestones.

#### Tests

- **271 doctest cases / 4360 assertions** passing on Windows / MSVC
  Release.
- **Harbour smoke** harness producing a runnable `smoke.exe` that
  drives the full read + write + index + multi-tag + transaction +
  memo + compound-expression path through `rddads.lib` and OpenADS'
  `ace64.dll`.

## Roadmap

OpenADS ships in three rough phases. Each row links to the milestone
tag that lands the work; partial milestones become `done` once their
follow-ups merge.

### 0.1.x — drop-in for the Harbour read/write path (DONE)

Validated against `c:\harbour\contrib\rddads.lib` end-to-end through
`tests/harbour_smoke/smoke.prg`.

### 0.2.x — broaden the ABI surface, polish the engine (DONE — 0.2.0 released)

| Tag | Milestone |
|-----|-----------|
| `m9.1-done`      | Compound CDX expressions evaluator (`UPPER`, `STR`, concat, ...) |
| `m9.2-done`      | Stub batch reorganised into real / no-op / missing |
| `m9.3-done`      | Compound expressions validated end-to-end via Harbour |
| `m9.4-done`      | `AdsGotoRecord` + table/file metadata real impls |
| `m9.5-done`      | `AdsCreateTable` (rddads field-def parser → DBF on disk) |
| `m9.6-done`      | `AdsRefreshRecord` + `AdsExtractKey` |
| `m9.7-done`      | `AdsCreateIndex61` with compound-expression support |
| `m9.8-done`      | `AdsZapTable` + `AdsPackTable` |
| `m9.9-done`      | `AdsReindex` — rebuild every bound index from current records |
| `m9.10-done`     | NTX multi-level B+tree split (closes M3.7 limit) |
| `m9.11-done`     | `AdsCopyTable` / `AdsCopyTableContents` / `AdsConvertTable` |
| `m9.12-done`     | `AdsFindFirstTable` / `AdsFindNextTable` / `AdsFindClose` (`*` / `?` glob, case-insensitive, returns `AE_NO_FILE_FOUND` when exhausted) |
| `m9.13-done`     | `AdsGetBinaryLength` / `AdsGetBinary` / `AdsSetBinary` + real `AdsGetMemoDataType` (FPT block-type tag round-trip; `ADS_BINARY` → `Object`, `ADS_IMAGE` → `Picture`, text → `Text`; offset-based chunked reads) |
| `m9.14-done`     | NTX multi-tag binding — multiple `.ntx` files coexist on one Table (`AdsOpenIndex` / `AdsCreateIndex61` / legacy `AdsCreateIndex` are all additive; same-path reopen refreshes; `AdsCloseIndex` releases extra views without disturbing the active order) |
| `m9.15-done`     | Real `AdsGetServerName` / `AdsGetServerTime` — local host name + ISO date / `HH:MM:SS` time + ms-of-day, plus the 6-arg `AdsGetServerTime` shape rddads' `ADSGETSERVERTIME` actually expects (the previous 2-arg stub left rddads' on-stack date/time bufs uninitialised). Also fixes a latent index-binding leak: `AdsCloseTable` / `AdsCloseAllTables` / `AdsDisconnect` now purge the global binding map so a future Table allocation at the same heap address can't inherit stale entries. |
| `m9.16-done`     | Chunked `AdsSetBinary` — per-`(table, field)` accumulator lets rddads deliver an oversized `ADS_BINARY` / `ADS_IMAGE` payload across several calls (`ulOffset != 0`, `ulBytes < ulTotalBytes`); the field only lands in the memo store once every byte arrives. Mid-write chunks that would run past the announced total fail; pending state is dropped at table teardown. |
| `m9.17-done`     | Unicode `*W` variants — `AdsSetStringW` / `AdsGetStringW` / `AdsGetFieldW`. UTF-16LE ↔ UTF-8 transcoding at the ABI boundary; field names accept both UTF-16 NUL-terminated strings and `ADSFIELD(n)`-style numeric indices (low-pointer encoded). Engine continues to store byte sequences without a fixed codepage assumption. |
| `m9.18-done`     | Lock retry / cycle policy — `AdsSetLockCycle` / `AdsGetLockCycle` / `AdsSetLockRetryCount` / `AdsGetLockRetryCount` (ms between attempts + retry count, defaults 100 ms / 10 retries). `AdsLockTable` / `AdsLockRecord` switched to non-blocking byte-range acquires (`LockMgr::try_lock_*` / `LockFileEx LOCKFILE_FAIL_IMMEDIATELY` / `fcntl F_SETLK`) and re-attempt up to the configured budget before reporting `AE_LOCKED`. |
| `m9.19-done`     | `AdsCreateFTSIndex` — clean-room OpenADS-native `.fts` inverted-index file (UTF-8 text: `# OpenADS FTS v0` header + sorted `<token>\t<recno1>,<recno2>,...` rows). Tokeniser respects `ulMinWordLen` / `ulMaxWordLen`, custom delimiter / noise-word arrays, plus a default ASCII delimiter set and an English stop-word seed. Search-side functions remain a follow-up milestone. |
| `m9.20-done`     | `AdsAddCustomKey` / `AdsDeleteCustomKey` — manual-mode (key, recno) injection on the current record. Each call evaluates the index's expression against the positioned row and routes through the existing `IIndex::insert` / `IIndex::erase` paths, matching rddads' `DBOI_KEYADD` / `DBOI_KEYDELETE` call sites. |
| `m9.21-done`     | FTS search side — `AdsFTSSearch(hConn, pucFile, pucQuery, paRecnos, *pulCount)` loads the `.fts` file, tokenises the query, intersects per-token recno lists (AND semantics), and writes the hit list into `paRecnos` with truncation reporting. SQL gains a `CONTAINS(<col>, '<query>')` predicate that lowers to a precomputed recno set captured in the row predicate, so the FTS lookup runs once per query instead of per row. |
| `m9.22-done`     | UTF-8 codepoint-aware index-expression evaluator — `UPPER`, `LOWER`, `SUBSTR` walk codepoints instead of bytes. ASCII + Latin-1 supplement (incl. `ÿ↔Ÿ`) case map cleanly; codepoints outside that range pass through. `INDEX ON UPPER(name)` over a UTF-8 column now produces stable keys for non-ASCII rows. Bare-field indexes still byte-identical (existing CDX / NTX files round-trip unchanged). |
| `m9.23-done`     | Misc MISS fillers — real `AdsGetLongLong`, `AdsSetFieldRaw`, `AdsVerifySQL`, `AdsFailedTransactionRecovery`, `AdsGetAllLocks`, `AdsSkipUnique`. |
| `m9.24-done`     | Local-mode `AdsMg*` surface (15 calls). Synthetic mgmt handle, struct-shaped queries zero-fill caller buffers, list-shaped queries report empty count; apps see "everything quiescent" instead of `AE_FUNCTION_NOT_AVAILABLE`. |
| `m9.25-done`     | Local-mode `AdsDD*` CRUD surface (14 calls). All 14 accept silently / zero-fill. 0.3.x will replace these no-ops with real persistence in the OpenADS DD format. |
| `m9.26-done`     | `AdsRestructureTable` (ADD-fields path) — rewrites the DBF with the original schema + `pucAddFields` appended, copies every record's old-field bytes verbatim and blank-pads the new fields. The MISS list is now empty. |
| `m9.27-done`     | CI matrix portability fix — `legacy_crt_shims.cpp` is now a no-op on POSIX builds; the engine compiles cleanly on Linux + macOS through `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (windows-2022 / ubuntu-22.04 / macos-13). |
| **`v0.2.0`**     | **Final 0.2.0 release** (2026-05-04) |

#### Post-0.2.0 polish (rolled into 0.3.x)

- **Linux Harbour smoke install.** The engine builds + tests cleanly
  on Linux + macOS through the CI matrix; what's still missing is a
  Linux Harbour install so the smoke harness (`smoke.exe` →
  `ace64.dll`) can run end-to-end on a non-Windows runner.
- **`usPageSize` honoured beyond NTX/CDX.** `AdsCreateIndex61` /
  `AdsCreateFTSIndex` accept a `usPageSize` argument. NTX (1024)
  and FoxPro CDX (512) are fixed-size by their on-disk format —
  matching the behaviour of the original ACE — so OpenADS records
  the value but doesn't change the layout. Variable page sizes will
  land alongside the proprietary ADI driver in 0.3.x.

### 0.3.x — proprietary formats + advanced SQL (IN PROGRESS)

OpenADS will only adopt the proprietary formats once a clean-room
compatibility specification is available — written from publicly
observable behaviour and from the Harbour `contrib/rddads` source,
not from disassembly of SAP-owned binaries or from any material
whose use is restricted by the Advantage SDK / ACE EULA.

| Tag | Milestone |
|-----|-----------|
| `m10.1-done` | Real OpenADS-native DD persistence — replaces M9.25 silent-success no-ops with round-trip storage in the v1 text format (USER / MEMBER / LINK / INDEX / RI / DBPROP / USERPROP rows); `Connection::open(<.add>)` callers now see CRUD writes survive across reopens. |
| `m10.2-done` | VFP `I` (4-byte int32) / `Y` (8-byte currency, money * 10000) / `B` (8-byte IEEE-754 double) field decode + encode round-trip. |
| `m10.3-done` | SQL `WHERE` — full boolean expression tree (`OR` / `NOT` / parens) on top of the M9.21 `CONTAINS` predicate; numeric literals (`AGE >= 18`) and string literals coexist. |
| `m10.4-done` | `AdsRestructureTable` DELETE-fields path + real `AdsSetIndexDirection` (active order walks reverse on demand). The function-level Ads* surface is now MISS-free; CHANGE-fields still deferred. |
| `m10.5-done` | SQL `INSERT INTO <t> (cols) VALUES (lits)` — string + numeric literals; AdsExecuteSQLDirect dispatches by leading keyword. |
| `m10.6-done` | SQL `ORDER BY <col> [ASC|DESC]` — materialises matching recnos via the WHERE filter, sorts by the column's typed value (numeric vs string driven by field type), installs the result as the cursor's traversal sequence. |
| `m10.7-done` | SQL `UPDATE <t> SET col=lit, … [WHERE …]` + `DELETE FROM <t> [WHERE …]` — bulk row mutation through AdsExecuteSQLDirect. DELETE follows Clipper convention (rows marked, not removed; AdsPackTable evicts later). |
| `m10.8-done` | SQL projection lists — `SELECT col1, col2 FROM …`; cursor reports only the projected columns (in the listed order) via AdsGetNumFields / AdsGetFieldName / AdsGetFieldType / AdsGetFieldLength / AdsGetFieldDecimals / ADSFIELD(n). |
| `m10.9-done`  | SQL DDL — `CREATE TABLE <name> (<col> <Type> [(<len>[,<dec>])], …)` + `CREATE INDEX <tag> ON <table> (<expr>) [DESCENDING] [UNIQUE]`. Both lower into the engine's existing AdsCreateTable / AdsCreateIndex61 entry points. |
| `m10.10-done` | SQL aggregates — `COUNT(*) / COUNT(col) / SUM / AVG / MIN / MAX(col)`. The cursor is a synthetic 1-row temp DBF (one C(30) column per aggregate). |
| `m10.11-done` | VFP autoinc fields — descriptor offsets 18 (flags) / 19-22 (counter LE) / 23 (step). `AppendRecord` pre-fills the field with the current counter and persists `next = counter + step` back to disk. Counter survives close + reopen. |
| `m10.12-done` | `AdsRestructureTable` CHANGE-fields — same-type length / decimals overrides for existing columns. Type conversion still surfaces `AE_FUNCTION_NOT_AVAILABLE` (clean-room policy). |
| `m10.13-done` | SQL `INNER JOIN <b> ON <l_col> = <r_col>` — parser. |
| `m10.14-done` | SQL `INNER JOIN` executor — hash on right column, materialise merged rows into temp DBF cursor; right-side fields prefixed `R_`. Combos with WHERE / ORDER BY / aggregates over the joined cursor land in a follow-up. |
| `m10.15-done` | SQL `<col> IN (…)` — literal list `IN ('a', 'b', …)` and subquery `IN (SELECT col FROM t)`. Matching set captured at compile time so per-row check is O(1). |
| `m10.16-done` | SQL `LEFT [OUTER] JOIN` — left rows survive without a right-side match (right fields blank-pad); bare `JOIN` keyword treated as INNER per SQL convention. |
| `m10.17-done` | SQL `EXISTS (SELECT … FROM t)` — uncorrelated presence test, materialised once at compile time. `NOT EXISTS` falls out of the existing NOT-tree. |
| `m10.18-done` | SQL scalar subquery — `<col> op (SELECT <col> FROM <t>)`. Inner subquery's first projected value lands in the cmp's literal slot at compile time; outer-column type drives string vs numeric compare semantics. |
| `m10.19-done` | SQL aggregate scalar subquery — `<col> op (SELECT MAX(x)/MIN/SUM/AVG/COUNT FROM t)`. The single aggregate lands in the cmp's number slot at compile time. |
| `m10.20-done` | SQL JOIN combined with WHERE / ORDER BY in a single statement. Outer clauses compile against the merged cursor's schema (left names verbatim, right names `R_<orig>`). |
| `m10.21-done` | SQL `RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN` — every right row survives, blank left when no match. Hash built on LEFT column; merged cursor schema stays direction-agnostic. |
| `m10.22-done` | SQL `FULL [OUTER] JOIN` — union of LEFT + RIGHT semantics; left walk emits matched + LEFT-style fillers and tracks which right recnos were matched, then a follow-up scan emits unmatched right rows with a blank left filler. |
| `m10.23-done` | SQL JOIN + aggregate combo — `COUNT/SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX` over the merged JOIN cursor; aggregate walk runs after the M10.20 outer WHERE, materialises a 1-row temp DBF with C(30) per aggregate. |
| `m10.24-done` | SQL correlated EXISTS subquery — `EXISTS (SELECT … FROM b WHERE b.x = a.y)` re-evaluates per outer row; outer-column refs in the subquery WHERE bind to the live outer cursor. |
| `m10.25-done` | SQL `GROUP BY <col>[, <col>…] [HAVING <agg> op num]` — multi-row aggregate cursor (one row per group), preserves source column type byte + length, HAVING filters on a projection-aligned aggregate slot. |
| `m10.26-done` | SQL `UNION` / `UNION ALL` — N-way merge of `SELECT * FROM t [WHERE ...]` members; first member's schema drives the merged cursor; UNION dedups by raw record bytes, UNION ALL keeps duplicates. |
| `m10.27-done` | SQL UNION + member projection — UNION members may now carry a projection list (`SELECT col1, col2 FROM t`); first member's projection drives the merged DBF schema (preserving raw_type / length / decimals) and subsequent members align positionally. |
| `m10.28-done` | SQL UNION + ORDER BY — last UNION member may carry an `ORDER BY` clause; the sort applies to the merged result. Numeric vs lex compare follows the merged column type. |
| `m10.29-done` | SQL correlated scalar subquery — `<col> op (SELECT <col_or_agg> FROM b WHERE b.x = a.y)` re-evaluates per outer row, binding outer columns into the inner WHERE (M10.24 binding pattern reused). |
| `m10.30-done` | SQL HAVING tree — boolean AND / OR / NOT / parens over aggregate comparisons; e.g. `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 AND SUM(amt) > 50`. |
| `m10.31-done` | SQL `DISTINCT` — `SELECT DISTINCT [cols\|*] FROM ...` dedups by projected columns; first occurrence wins, applied post-WHERE / post-ORDER-BY. |
| `m10.32-done` | SQL `LIMIT N [OFFSET M]` — slices the post-clause traversal sequence (skip M, take N). |
| `m10.33-done` | SQL `BETWEEN` / `LIKE` — `<col> BETWEEN <lit1> AND <lit2>` (inclusive, numeric or lexicographic) and `<col> LIKE '<pattern>'` with SQL `%` (any sequence) and `_` (single char) wildcards. |
| `m10.34-done` | SQL GROUP BY across JOIN — `SELECT <agg>(...) FROM a JOIN b ON ... GROUP BY ...` produces one row per group of joined rows, mirroring the M10.25 grouped path on the merged cursor. |
| `m10.35-done` | SQL correlated IN subquery — `<col> IN (SELECT col FROM b WHERE b.x = a.y)` re-evaluates per outer row when the inner WHERE references an outer column. |
| `m10.37-done` | SQL multi-column ORDER BY — `ORDER BY a [ASC\|DESC], b [ASC\|DESC] ...` cascades on ties; per-column direction independent; numeric vs lex driven by column type. |
| `m11.1-done`  | VFP V (Varchar) + Q (Varbinary) field types — decode trims trailing NUL pad to recover the meaningful prefix; encode NUL-pads the unused tail so reads recover the original length. |
| `m11.3-done`  | TPS — `AdsReleaseSavepoint` drops a savepoint marker without rolling back; nested `AdsBeginTransaction` / `AdsCommitTransaction` increment / decrement depth (only the outermost commit flushes); inner ROLLBACK still aborts every nesting level. |
| `m10.38-done` | SQL `CASE WHEN <cond> THEN <lit> [WHEN ...] [ELSE <lit>] END [AS alias]` in projection — first matching branch wins; result lands in a C(30) cell of the materialised result cursor. Conditions may use Cmp / AND / OR / NOT / BETWEEN / LIKE. |
| `m10.36-done` | SQL UNION + complex members — UNION members may now carry JOIN, GROUP BY, aggregates, CASE, DISTINCT, LIMIT. Dispatcher recurses into AdsExecuteSQLDirect per member (state mutex is recursive); each member's cursor schema drives merge alignment via `cursor_projections`. |
| `m11.4-done`  | AEP host — `CREATE PROCEDURE <name> AS '<dll>::<sym>'` registers an external function on a connection; `EXECUTE PROCEDURE <name>(args)` calls it through `platform/dll` (LoadLibrary / dlopen) and returns its result string in a 1-row C(255) `RESULT` cursor. Clean-room ABI: `int proc(const char* args, char* out_buf, size_t out_cap)`; not byte-compatible with the legacy ADS Extended Procedure protocol. |
| `m11.2-done`  | OpenADS-encrypted DBF (AES-256-CTR) — header byte 0xC3 marks an OpenADS-encrypted variant; record bodies XOR with an AES-256-CTR keystream keyed off the connection password (`AdsSetEncryptionPassword`). `AdsEncryptTable` upgrades a plain DBF in place. Schema stays plaintext. **Not byte-compatible** with proprietary SAP ADS encrypted .adt files — that format's byte boundary remains undocumented. |
| `m10.39-done` | SQL scalar string fns — `UPPER` / `LOWER` / `LEN` / `TRIM` / `LTRIM` / `RTRIM` over a single column in projection, optional `AS alias`. Materialised result cell is C(N). |
| `m10.40-done` | SQL arithmetic in projection — `<col> {+,-,*,/} <num_or_col>` evaluated as doubles, formatted with `%g` into a C(30) cell. |
| `m10.41-done` | SQL `INSERT INTO t (cols) SELECT ...` — inner SELECT may use any engine clause; rows copy positionally into the target via the existing append path. |
| `m10.42-done` | SQL `CREATE TABLE t AS SELECT ...` — derives the new table's schema from the inner cursor's projection, creates the DBF, bulk-copies rows. |
| `m10.43-done` | SQL multi-arg scalar fns — `SUBSTR(col, start, [len])`, `CONCAT(a, b, ...)`, `REPLACE(col, old, new)`. Each arg may be column / string / numeric literal. |
| `m10.45-done` | SQL date arithmetic on YYYYMMDD strings — `DATEDIFF(a, b)` (days), `DATEADD(col, n)` (returns YYYYMMDD). |
| `m10.46-done` | SQL derived tables — `FROM (SELECT ...) [AS alias]`. Inner SELECT runs through the recursive dispatcher; outer WHERE / ORDER BY / projection apply on top of its cursor. |
| `m10.48-done` | SQL Common Table Expression — `WITH name AS (SELECT ...) SELECT ... FROM name`. Rewritten in parse_select to a derived-table form by inline-substituting `name` with `(<inner>)`. |
| `m10.44-done` | SQL `<col> IS [NOT] NULL` — first checks the VFP NULL bitmap (M11.6); falls back to a trim-trailing-space check that treats all-blank cells as NULL for non-bitmap-bearing DBFs. |
| `m10.47-done` | SQL `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (...)` in projection — first cut emits the 1-based position in the materialised result cursor; PARTITION BY / ORDER BY inside the OVER are parsed but ignored. |
| `m11.6-done`  | VFP NULL bitmap — `parse_dbf_fields` detects flags-byte bit 1 + assigns each nullable field a `null_bit` ordinal; `Table::is_field_null` reads `_NullFlags` system column and tests the bit. |
| `m12.1-done`  | Phase 2 wire-protocol skeleton — `network/wire.{h,cpp}` defines a length-prefixed frame (4 BE bytes + opcode + payload) with an Opcode enum reserved for Hello / Connect / OpenTable / ExecuteSQL / Fetch / Disconnect / Error. No socket layer yet. |
| `m11.7-done`  | String collation — `AdsSetCollation(hConn, BINARY\|NOCASE)`. Connection-scoped flag stamps onto every WHERE Cmp; NOCASE lowercases ASCII A-Z before compare across Eq/Ne/Lt/Gt/Le/Ge/Between/Like. |
| `m11.8-done`  | OEM (CP437) ↔ UTF-8 conversion — `AdsConvertOemToAnsi` / `AdsConvertAnsiToOem` round-trip text through a new `engine/codepage` module carrying the public IBM CP437 upper-half table. |
| `m10.49-done` | SQL window OVER (PARTITION BY + ORDER BY) — pre-computes per-row values into a side map; partitions group by concatenated key, ORDER BY drives within-partition order. |
| `m10.50-done` | SQL `RANK()` / `DENSE_RANK()` — join ROW_NUMBER in the window family; RANK skips on ties, DENSE_RANK doesn't. Tie detection via the ORDER BY key. |
| `m10.51-done` | SQL qualified column refs — `<alias>.<col>` in WHERE / projection / JOIN ON; read_identifier consumes the suffix and resolves the bare column name. |
| `m10.52-done` | SQL multi-row `INSERT INTO t (cols) VALUES (...), (...), ...` — appends one record per tuple. |
| `m10.53-done` | SQL `NULLIF(a,b)` / `COALESCE(a,b,...)` / `IFNULL(expr,default)` — null-handling helpers in projection (empty string = NULL by convention). |
| `m10.54-done` | SQL aggregate `<agg>(...) FILTER (WHERE <expr>)` — per-slot row filter; CountStar with FILTER uses the filtered count, others always do. |
| `m12.2-done`  | Phase 2 TCP socket layer — `network/socket.{h,_win32.cpp,_posix.cpp}`. listen / accept / connect / send / recv / close + ephemeral-port binding. Win32 links ws2_32. |
| `m12.3-done`  | Phase 2 server skeleton — `network/server` spawns an accept thread + per-connection session thread. Dispatches Hello → HelloAck (version), Connect → ConnectAck (data_dir echo), Disconnect → close, others → Error frame. recv_exact / read_frame / write_frame helpers exposed for M12.4 / M12.5. |
| `m12.4-done`  | Phase 2 remote read-only table ops — server proxies OpenTable / GotoTop / Skip / GetField / GetRecordCount / AtEOF / CloseTable. Per-session engine::Connection + 32-bit table-id map. |
| `m12.5-done`  | Phase 2 dual-mode DLL — `AdsConnect60("tcp://host:port/<dir>", ...)` opens a wire client; AdsOpenTable / AdsGotoTop / AdsSkip / AdsGetField / AdsGetRecordCount / AdsAtEOF / AdsCloseTable / AdsDisconnect each branch on remote-handle kind. ace64.dll is now drop-in for either local or TCP-server mode. |
| `m12.6-done`  | Phase 2 remote write surface — server proxies AppendBlank / SetField / DeleteRecord / RecallRecord / GotoRecord / FlushTable; AdsAppendRecord / AdsSetString / AdsDeleteRecord / AdsRecallRecord / AdsGotoRecord / AdsWriteRecord each gate a remote branch. SetField wire payload is `[u32 tid][u16 name_len][name][value]`; engine stores via `Table::set_field(idx, std::string)`. Round-trip verified by reopening the same DBF locally and confirming the new record + value hit disk. |
| `m12.7-done`  | Phase 2 remote SQL exec — `AdsCreateSQLStatement` on a remote connection allocates a wire-aware statement; `AdsExecuteSQLDirect` ships the SQL through a new `ExecuteSQL`/`ExecuteSQLAck` opcode pair. Server lazily opens a parallel ABI connection on first use, runs the query through `AdsExecuteSQLDirect`, and wraps the returned cursor handle in `cursor_tbls` so the M12.4 read ops (`GotoTop` / `Skip` / `GetField` / `GetRecordCount` / `AtEOF` / `CloseTable`) serve it through the same wire. Returns cursor table-id (0 = no cursor for INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE / DDL). |
| `m12.8-done`  | Phase 2 remote `AdsReindex` — new `Reindex`/`ReindexAck` opcode pair routes through `engine::Table::reindex()` on the per-session connection. `CREATE INDEX` is already covered by M12.7's `ExecuteSQL` DDL path. |
| `m12.9-done`  | Phase 2 server credential auth — `Connect` frame payload extended to `[u16 dlen][dir][u16 ulen][user][u16 plen][password]`; `Server::add_credential` registers a user/password pair; empty map = back-compat dev mode (any client passes). `AdsConnect60` forwards `pucUser` / `pucPwd` through the wire. RemoteConnection now self-disconnects on drop so a failed connect doesn't leave the server-side session blocked in `read_frame()`. |
| `m12.10-done` | Phase 2 ACE error-code propagation — `Error` frame payload now starts with `[u32 LE ace_code][message]`; server folds either a literal ACE code or a code pulled from a sub-result's `util::Error` into every Error frame. Client parses the prefix back into `util::Error.code` so the `Ads*` return value surfaces the real ACE code (`AE_LOGIN_FAILED` 7077, `AE_NO_FILE_FOUND` 5018, `AE_PARSE_ERROR` 7200, …) instead of the legacy generic `AE_INTERNAL_ERROR` 5000. |

#### Still planned for 0.3.x

- **M11.5 ADT** (proprietary table format) — depends on a
  clean-room specification of the ADT on-disk layout. None is
  publicly available; the only known route is reverse-
  engineering SAP-owned binaries, which violates the project's
  clean-room policy and the Advantage SDK / ACE EULA. Not
  implementable until a clean-room spec exists.
- **VFP** NULL-bitmap extension — the `0x32` autoinc / null-flag
  header byte stays deferred. Autoinc (M10.11) and V / Q types
  (M11.1) are real today.
- **ADM** memo format — pairs with ADT, same gating as ADT.
- **ADI** index format — proprietary B+tree variant; same gating.
- **Phase 2 server hardening** (M12.6+) — remote write ops
  (Insert / Update / Delete via wire), remote SQL exec
  (`AdsExecuteSQLDirect` over the wire), remote index ops
  (`CreateIndex` / `Reindex`), authentication + connection
  multiplexing, full ACE error-code mapping over the wire,
  large-payload streaming (memo blobs / SQL result sets).
  Read-only Open / Goto / Skip / GetField / GetRecordCount /
  AtEOF / CloseTable already round-trip through the M12.4 server
  and the M12.5 dual-mode client.
- **More SQL** — ORDER BY across DISTINCT, multi-column ORDER BY
  inside UNION, richer projection expressions on top of CASE,
  arithmetic and string concat (already partial via M10.39 /
  M10.40 / M10.43).

### 1.0.x — TCP server (Phase 2)

- Server reuses the same engine; clients speak the original ACE
  remote protocol so a single `ace64.dll` build can act as either a
  local DLL or a TCP client to a remote OpenADS server.
- Network framing + auth + connection multiplexing.
- Compatibility-test matrix against real Advantage 11.x + 12.x
  installations.

## Phase 1 scope

| Topic | Decision |
|------|----------|
| Operation mode | LOCAL only (no remote server). Phase 2 will add a TCP server reusing the same engine. |
| Table formats | ADT + CDX + NTX + VFP (all four ADS-supported types). |
| Memo / index | ADM / FPT / DBT (memo) · ADI / CDX / NTX (index). |
| ABI compatibility | Identical C ABI to ACE; applications do not recompile. |
| Validation frontend | `c:\harbour\contrib\rddads`, unmodified. |
| SQL | Full Advantage SQL dialect (parser + planner + executor + xBase UDFs + AEP host for external stored procedures). |
| Concurrency | OS *byte-range* locking with ranges identical to ACE — coexistence with original ACE installations during migration. |
| Data Dictionary (`.add`) | Full support: member tables, users/groups/permissions, RI, views, procedures, links, validations, defaults. |
| Encryption | AES-128 / AES-256 (ADS 9+ format). The legacy proprietary cipher is out of scope for phase 1. |
| Transactions (TPS) | Multi-table ACID, savepoints, crash recovery via write-ahead log. |
| Platforms | Windows (x86 + x64), Linux, macOS, BSD. |
| Language / build | C++17 with `extern "C"` external ABI. CMake + GitHub Actions. |
| i18n | OEM ↔ ANSI ↔ UTF-8 ↔ UTF-16 (the API's `*W` variants). |
| License | Apache License 2.0. |

### Key boundaries

- **L1** is the only module with C ABI. Everything else is internal C++17.
- L4's **driver trait** is the extension point: each table format is a swappable driver.
- The **remote server** in phase 2 will simply be another L1 frontend (TCP transport layer); L2 through L5 are reused as is.
- The **SQL engine** (L3) consumes L4 only through `Cursor` and `Catalog`; it has no knowledge of file formats.
- The **LockMgr** preserves the exact byte-range semantics of ACE, allowing coexistence with original ACE installations on the same files during migration.

### Module notes

- **`src/abi/ace_exports.cpp`** is the only contact point with the C ABI. A `static constexpr` table maps each ACE entry point to its internal handler. Optionally generated by a script from `ace.h`.
- **`src/drivers/driver_trait.h`** defines the minimum interface: `open / close / read_record / write_record / seek / scan / index_create / index_seek / lock_range`. Each driver is roughly 3–5 files.
- **`src/engine/lock_mgr.cpp`** centralises lock ranges — the single source of truth for ACE coexistence.
- **`src/engine/tx_log.cpp`** and **`tx_recover.cpp`** are driver-independent: the WAL log records `(driver_id, page_no, before_image, after_image)` as opaque payloads.
- **`src/sql/`** is driver-independent and operates against an abstract `Cursor`. SQL tests do not require real drivers (mock cursor).
- **`src/platform/`** is the only OS dependency. Engine tests use a platform mock to inject I/O failures.
- **`tools/`** is the debugging artillery — critical for byte-level diffs against original ACE.

  → each call drives one Executor::next() through L4 PageCache
  → AdsGetField → field decode (xBase types or ADT extended types,
                  depending on driver)
```

### Example C — Multi-table transaction

```
AdsBeginTransaction(hConn)
  → TxLog::begin(tx_id)         (write BEGIN record)
  → LockMgr::tx_attach(tx_id)

AdsLockRecord(hTblA, 42)
  → LockMgr::lock_record(tx_id, A, 42)   (escalates byte-range lock)

AdsUpdateRecord(hTblA, ...)
  → Table::update_record():
       1. Capture before-image of pages dirtied
       2. Apply change in PageCache
       3. TxLog::log_update(tx_id, A, page_no, before, after)

AdsAppendRecord(hTblB, ...)
  → similar, writes a log record for table B

AdsCommitTransaction(hConn)
  → TxLog::commit(tx_id)        (write COMMIT, fsync log)
  → PageCache::flush_tx_pages(tx_id)
  → LockMgr::tx_release(tx_id)

AdsRollbackTransaction(hConn)  [alternative]
  → TxLog::rollback_walk(tx_id):
       reverse-iterate log, restore before-images via PageCache
  → LockMgr::tx_release(tx_id)
```

#### Crash recovery (next process startup)

```
TxRecover::run()
  scan TxLog tail
  for each tx without COMMIT          → roll back (apply before-images)
  for each tx with COMMIT but pages unflushed → roll forward
  truncate log
```

## Concurrency and lock ranges

### Locking modes

`AdsLocking(ON | OFF)` selects the byte-range scheme:

| Mode | When to use | Coexistence |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Proprietary** (default) | ADS-only deployments | ADS-specific ranges, fastest |
| **Compatible** (`ADS_COMPATIBLE_LOCKING`) | Coexistence with Clipper / FoxPro / Harbour `DBF*` RDDs over the same files | Standard Clipper / FoxPro ranges |

OpenADS supports both modes. The `rddads` frontend selects via `AdsSetServerType(ADS_LOCAL_SERVER)` combined with `AdsLocking(ON | OFF)`.

### Granularity

Three hierarchical levels:

1. **File lock** (exclusive) — locks the whole table. `AdsLockTable` / `flock` open mode `EXCLUSIVE`.
2. **Record lock** — shared for reads, exclusive for writes. `AdsLockRecord(recno)`.
3. **Header lock** — first byte of the file header, taken only during writes that mutate the header (append, pack, zap, recno recalculation).

Rules:

- Open SHARED → acquires a shared header lock over the header range.
- Append / Pack / Zap → exclusive header lock plus an exclusive file-equivalent lock (Compatible mode uses byte `LOCKOFFSET_FILE`; Proprietary uses an internal ADS range).
- Update record → record lock required (RDD enforcement, not OS).
- Read record → no lock required in `READ COMMITTED`; `READ UNCOMMITTED` skips even versioning.

### Concrete byte-range layout

#### Compatible mode (Clipper / FoxPro coexistence)

```
DBF + NTX (Clipper scheme):
  FILE LOCK    : offset 1_000_000_000        size 1
  RECORD LOCK  : offset 1_000_000_001 + recno size 1

DBF + CDX (FoxPro scheme — descending):
  FILE LOCK    : offset 0x7FFFFFFE           size 1
  RECORD LOCK  : offset 0x7FFFFFFE - recno   size 1

DBF + VFP CDX (FoxPro VFP — same as CDX but offset 0x40000000-1):
  FILE LOCK    : offset 0x3FFFFFFE           size 1
  RECORD LOCK  : offset 0x3FFFFFFE - recno   size 1

ADT proprietary:
  FILE LOCK    : offset 0x80000000_00000000  size 0x10000  (64-bit)
  RECORD LOCK  : offset 0x80000000_00000000 + (recno << 16)  size 1
```

#### Proprietary mode

ADS-specific. The ranges are derived from captures of original ACE running over an instrumented filesystem and pinned in `docs/lock-ranges.md`. For phase 1 they are a constant table, validated by `tools/ace-trace`.

### LockMgr API (L4)

```cpp
class LockMgr {
public:
    // OS-level byte-range — inter-process coexistence
    Result<LockToken> lock_file_excl(FileHandle& fh, LockingMode mode);
    Result<LockToken> lock_record   (FileHandle& fh, LockingMode mode,
                                     uint64_t recno, LockType, Timeout);
    Result<>          unlock        (LockToken);

    // Tx-scoped — lifetime tied to TxLog::tx_id
    Result<>          lock_for_tx   (tx_id_t, FileHandle& fh,
                                     uint64_t recno, LockType);
    void              release_tx    (tx_id_t);

    // Intra-process re-entry
    bool              already_held  (FileHandle& fh, uint64_t recno) const;
};
```

Notes:

- **Intra-process re-entrancy.** A connection that already holds a record lock does not call the OS again; only a local counter is incremented.
- **Timeouts.** Per-connection (`AdsSetWaitTime`-equivalent), default 0 (fail fast).
- **Deadlock detection.** Cycle search over the `tx_id → resource → tx_id` graph. On detection, the youngest transaction is aborted (ADS does not document this precisely; OpenADS picks the youngest as victim).
- **Errors.** `AE_LOCKED` (5012) and `AE_LOCK_FAILED` (5013), mapped from LockMgr return codes.

### Coordination with TxLog

Inside an `AdsBeginTransaction` block, locks become tx-scoped: they are not released by `AdsUnlockRecord`, only by `AdsCommitTransaction` / `AdsRollbackTransaction`. This is required to preserve isolation guarantees.

Outside any transaction (autocommit), unlock releases immediately.

### Critical tests

- `lock_mgr_test.cpp` — re-entrancy, timeouts, deadlock detection.
- `tools/ace-trace` running real applications against original ACE → captures range logs → diffs against OpenADS.
- Multi-process conformance test: two OpenADS processes plus one original-ACE process operating on the same CDX table in Compatible mode — must complete without corruption.

## Transactions and write-ahead log

### Model

ARIES-lite. Page-level physiological logging. Multi-table atomicity. Nestable savepoints. Deterministic crash recovery.

### Log location

A single log shared per **data directory** (or per Data Dictionary if an `.add` file exists):

```
<data-dir>/openads.txlog          ← active log
<data-dir>/openads.txlog.<n>      ← rotated archives (truncated post-checkpoint)
<data-dir>/openads.checkpoint     ← latest CP record (LSN, dirty page table)
```

One log per DD avoids cross-DD coordination. Applications that do not use a DD but open tables in the same directory automatically share the log (detected by `Connection::open`).

### Record format

```
struct LogRecord {
    uint64_t  lsn;            // monotonic, unique
    uint64_t  prev_lsn;       // previous record in this tx (chain for undo)
    uint64_t  tx_id;
    uint16_t  type;           // BEGIN | UPDATE | INSERT | DELETE | ...
    uint16_t  driver_id;      // adt | cdx | ntx | vfp | memo | index
    uint32_t  table_id;       // assigned at first touch by tx
    uint64_t  page_no;
    uint16_t  before_len;
    uint16_t  after_len;
    uint8_t   payload[];      // before_image || after_image
    uint32_t  crc32c;         // record integrity
};
```

Record types:

| Type | Semantics |
|------|-----------|
| `BEGIN` | tx started, includes timestamp |
| `UPDATE` | physiological page update (before + after image) |
| `INSERT` | new record append (after only; undo = decrement recno) |
| `DELETE` | logical delete (after only; undo = clear deleted flag) |
| `INDEX_OP` | B+tree mutation (page split / merge / insert / delete key) |
| `MEMO_ALLOC` / `MEMO_FREE` | blob lifecycle in `.adm` / `.fpt` / `.dbt` |
| `SAVEPOINT` | named marker; `prev_lsn` chains here on partial rollback |
| `CLR` | compensation log record (written during undo, redo-only) |
| `COMMIT` | tx end ok, fsync barrier |
| `ABORT` | tx end rollback; all CLRs already written |
| `CHECKPOINT_BEGIN` / `CHECKPOINT_END` | stable point, dirty page table snapshot |

CLRs (compensation log records) make undo idempotent: a crash during rollback simply re-executes the CLRs without duplicating work (CLRs are redo-only, never undo).

### Group commit

```
AdsCommitTransaction(hConn)
  → TxLog::append(COMMIT_PENDING)              [in memory]
  → TxLog::group_commit_barrier()              [waits up to 10ms or N tx]
       └─ writev() batched COMMIT records
       └─ fsync(log_fd)
  → tx becomes visible
```

10 ms / 64 tx, whichever first (configurable). Reduces `fsync × N` to a single `fsync`.

### Savepoints

```
AdsCreateSavepoint(hConn, "sp1")
  → TxLog::append(SAVEPOINT name=sp1 lsn=L1)
  → conn->savepoint_stack.push("sp1", L1)

AdsRollbackTransaction80(hConn, "sp1")    // partial
  → walk back log from current_lsn to L1, write CLRs for each record
  → discard savepoints above sp1
  // tx still active
```

The classic `AdsRollbackTransaction()` performs a full rollback to BEGIN.

### Recovery (startup)

Three ARIES-lite phases:

```
TxRecover::run() {
  // 1. ANALYSIS
  scan log forward from the last CHECKPOINT_BEGIN
  build active_tx_table  (tx_id → last_lsn)
  build dirty_page_table (page_id → first_lsn that dirtied it)

  // 2. REDO
  scan log forward from min(dirty_page_table.first_lsn)
  for each UPDATE / INDEX_OP / INSERT / DELETE / CLR:
      if page.lsn < record.lsn:                 // not yet applied
          apply after_image to page
          page.lsn = record.lsn

  // 3. UNDO (loser txs only — no COMMIT seen)
  for each tx in active_tx_table sorted by last_lsn DESC:
      walk prev_lsn chain
      for each non-CLR record:
          apply before_image
          write CLR(undo_next_lsn = record.prev_lsn)
      write ABORT record
}
```

Determinism: re-entering recovery N times produces the same final state (idempotent via CLRs).

### Page LSN

Each page (DBF, ADT, CDX, NTX, ADI, memo) carries an 8-byte LSN at the end of its page footer. Cost: 8 bytes per page. Required to skip already-applied redo work.

**Compatible mode exception.** DBF / CDX / NTX pages in Compatible mode do not carry an inline LSN footer (it would break byte compatibility with Clipper / FoxPro applications). Workaround: in Compatible mode `TxLog` keeps a separate `lsn_table` (overlay file `.lsnmap`) instead of inlining the LSN. The cost is an extra page of I/O per commit, which is acceptable.

### Checkpointing

A background thread:

- Runs every 30 s or every 1000 transactions (configurable).
- Writes `CHECKPOINT_BEGIN` with a snapshot of `active_tx_table` and `dirty_page_table`.
- Flushes dirty pages with `lsn ≤ checkpoint_lsn`.
- Writes `CHECKPOINT_END`.
- Truncates `openads.txlog.<n>` archives older than the checkpoint.

### Recoverable vs unrecoverable errors

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Crash with pending tx | Recovery rollback |
| CRC failure on a log record | Stop recovery at the last valid record, log a warning |
| Missing log file at startup | Assume clean shutdown (legacy ACE behaviour) |
| Page LSN > log tail LSN | Log corruption → halt, requires manual intervention |
| Out of space during commit | Force partial fsync → mark log full → reject new tx until space is freed |

### Tests

- `tx_log_test.cpp` — unit: write / read / CRC / replay.
- `tx_recover_test.cpp` — inject a crash at every LSN boundary, verify consistency.
- `tools/tx-replay <log>` — human-readable dump and dry-run replay.
- Conformance: simulate `AdsBegin / Update / Crash` with `kill -9` mid-write, verify a consistent restart.

### Lexer

Hand-written DFA. Recognises:

- Case-insensitive keywords (~150).
- Identifiers: `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`, plus delimited `[name]` and `"name"`.
- Literals: int, float, string (ANSI plus `''` escape), date `{^YYYY-MM-DD}`, boolean `.T.` / `.F.` (xBase).
- Operators: ANSI plus xBase `=`, `==`, `!=`, `#`, `$` (substring contains), `||`.
- Parameters: `?` positional, `:name` named.

Output: stream of `Token { kind, lexeme, line, col }`. Errors carry source position.

### Parser

Recursive descent plus a Pratt parser for expressions (ANSI precedence plus xBase `$` and `||`).

EBNF grammar in `docs/sql-grammar.md`. Key productions:

```ebnf
SelectStmt   := WithClause? "SELECT" SelectList FromClause? WhereClause?
                GroupByClause? HavingClause? OrderByClause?
                LimitClause? (CompoundOp SelectStmt)?
FromClause   := "FROM" TableRef ("," TableRef)*
TableRef     := QualifiedName ("AS"? Alias)?
              | "(" SelectStmt ")" "AS"? Alias                  -- derived
              | TableRef JoinType TableRef "ON" Expr            -- join
JoinType     := "INNER" | "LEFT" "OUTER"? | "RIGHT" "OUTER"? |
                "FULL" "OUTER"? | "CROSS"
CompoundOp   := "UNION" "ALL"? | "INTERSECT" | "EXCEPT"
Expr         := PrimaryExpr (InfixOp Expr)*                     -- Pratt
PrimaryExpr  := Literal | ColumnRef | FuncCall | CaseExpr |
                "(" Expr ")" | SubQuery | Parameter |
                "CAST" "(" Expr "AS" TypeName ")"
CaseExpr     := "CASE" Expr? ("WHEN" Expr "THEN" Expr)+
                ("ELSE" Expr)? "END"
```

The AST is built from sum types (`std::variant`) per category. Visitor pattern for passes.

### Resolver

- **Name binding.** Tables are looked up via `Catalog` (DD-aware when the connection has a DD). Columns are searched in the current scope, including CTEs, derived tables, and `JOIN USING`.
- **`*` expansion.** `SELECT *` becomes a list of `ColumnRef`; `t.*` expands only columns of `t`.
- **Type check.** Arithmetic on numeric, concatenation on character, comparison on compatible types. xBase coercions are permissive (`numeric` ↔ `string` implicit conversion is configurable).
- **Aggregate detection.** Marks expressions as aggregate or scalar; validates `HAVING` vs `WHERE`.
- **Subquery scope.** Correlated references are annotated with `outer_scope_depth`.
- **Errors.** `AE_PARSE_ERROR` (7200), `AE_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND` (5063), and so on.

### Planner (logical)

Generates a relational algebra tree of Volcano nodes:

```
LogicalNode = Scan(table)
            | Filter(child, pred)
            | Project(child, exprs)
            | Sort(child, keys)
            | TopN(child, k)
            | Aggregate(child, group_keys, aggs)
            | Distinct(child)
            | Join(left, right, kind, pred)
            | Union(left, right, all?)
            | CTE(name, child)
            | Insert / Update / Delete (table, source, set, pred)
```

Canonical construction first, no optimisation.

### Optimizer

Rule and cost passes:

| Pass | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `predicate_pushdown` | rule | Pushes Filter below Join / Project when column refs allow. |
| `column_pruning` | rule | Project drops columns not used upstream. |
| `constant_folding` | rule | Evaluates constant expressions. |
| `predicate_simplify` | rule | `x AND TRUE → x`, `NOT NOT x → x`, etc. |
| `index_selection` | cost | Matches Filter predicates against available indexes → IndexScan. |
| `join_order` | cost | Selinger-style DP up to 8 tables, greedy beyond. |
| `join_method` | cost | NLJ vs HashJoin vs MergeJoin based on cardinality and ordering. |
| `sort_avoidance` | rule | If the Sort key is a prefix of the IndexScan order, drop the Sort. |
| `aggregate_pushdown` | rule | Pre-aggregates locally when group keys are a subset of the partition. |
| `topn_pushdown` | rule | `LIMIT k` paired with index order becomes early-stop IndexScan. |

Cost model:

- Row-count estimation uses per-table statistics in `Catalog` (recno plus simple equi-width index histograms).
- I/O cost is page reads (CdxIndex 8 KB, ADT 4 KB typical).
- CPU cost is `row_count × per-op constant`.

### PhysicalPlan / Executor

Volcano iterators. Each `next()` returns `Optional<Row>`.

Physical operators:

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SeqScanOp` | Iterates a `Cursor` over a `Table`, reading via L4 `Table::scan()`. |
| `IndexScanOp` | `Cursor` follows `Index::seek_range()`. |
| `IndexLookupOp` | Nested-loop join inner side via index seek. |
| `FilterOp` | Predicate evaluation, drops false rows. |
| `ProjectOp` | Per-row expression evaluation. |
| `SortOp` | External merge sort, runs in `<data-dir>/openads.tmp.<N>`. |
| `TopNOp` | Min-heap with k slots. |
| `HashAggregateOp` | Hash-table aggregation. |
| `StreamAggregateOp` | Input already ordered by group keys. |
| `DistinctOp` | Hash set. |
| `NestedLoopJoinOp` | Outer × inner (with index seek when available). |
| `HashJoinOp` | Builds a hash on the smaller side, probes. |
| `MergeJoinOp` | Both sides ordered (after `sort_avoidance`). |
| `UnionOp` / `UnionAllOp` | Concat plus optional dedupe. |
| `CTEScanOp` | Reuses a materialised CTE result. |
| `InsertOp` / `UpdateOp` / `DeleteOp` | DML, writes via `Table` API and `TxLog`. |

External sort: runs up to `mem_budget` (default 64 MB), spills to tempfiles, K-way merge.

Hash join build: if the hash table exceeds the budget, falls back to Grace Hash (partition plus spill).

### xBase scalar UDFs

Registered in `src/sql/func/scalar.cpp`. Subset (~80 functions):

```
String : LEFT, RIGHT, SUBSTR, AT, RAT, LTRIM, RTRIM, ALLTRIM, PADL, PADR,
         PADC, REPL, SPACE, UPPER, LOWER, STUFF, STRTRAN, LIKE, MATCH
Date   : CTOD, DTOS, DTOC, STOD, DAY, MONTH, YEAR, DOW, CMONTH, CDOW,
         DATE, TIME, NOW, DATEADD, DATEDIFF
Numeric: STR, VAL, INT, ROUND, MOD, ABS, MAX, MIN, EXP, LOG, SQRT,
         SIGN, FLOOR, CEILING
Logic  : IIF, IsNULL, COALESCE, NULLIF, CASE
Type   : CAST, CONVERT, EMPTY, TYPE
Misc   : RECNO, RECCOUNT, DELETED, FOUND, EOF, BOF, LASTREC,
         FIELDNAME, FIELDPOS, FCOUNT
```

Aggregates: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `STDDEV`, `VARIANCE`, plus xBase `TOTAL`.

The UDF registry allows AEP plugins to add custom functions.

### AEP host (stored procedures)

Advantage Extended Procedures are `.dll` / `.so` plugins exposing a C ABI. Loading and invocation:

```cpp
// AEP plugin entry (mirrored from the ADS spec):
extern "C" UNSIGNED32 GetProcInfo(...);
extern "C" UNSIGNED32 InvokeProc(IInvokeContext*);

// IInvokeContext = ABI exposed by OpenADS to the plugin:
struct IInvokeContext {
    UNSIGNED32 (*GetInputRowFieldCount)(...);
    UNSIGNED32 (*GetInputRowField)(...);
    UNSIGNED32 (*WriteOutputRow)(...);
    UNSIGNED32 (*OpenTable)(...);
    // ... ~30 functions
};
```

`AepHost` (`src/sql/aep/host.cpp`):

- Resolves `dll_name + entry` from DD properties `ADS_DD_PROC_DLL_*`.
- Lazy `dlopen` / `LoadLibrary` on first call.
- Marshals input / output arguments through a stable ABI.
- Sandboxing is optional; the plugin runs in-process (matching original ACE — no sandbox).

SQL invocation: `EXECUTE PROCEDURE my_proc(:p1)` causes the planner to emit `AepCallOp`.

Triggers (`BEFORE` / `AFTER INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE`) are AEP plugins fired by `Table::write_record` during DML.

### Prepared statements and cursors

```
AdsPrepareSQL(hStmt, sql)
  → parse + resolve + plan + optimize, caches the PhysicalPlan
  → parameter binding deferred
AdsExecuteSQL(hStmt)
  → binds parameters → executes → returns Cursor
```

Cursor types:

- **Forward-only** (default): `next()` only.
- **Scrollable** (`AdsCacheRecords ON`): materialised in a tempfile, supports `AdsGotoRecord(n)` and `AdsSkip(-N)`.

`PlanCache` (LRU, key = `SQL hash + schema_version`) avoids re-planning on repeats.

### Result rows backed by a cursor

`AdsGetField(hCursor, fieldName, ...)` reads the current row of the cursor. The cursor keeps a pointer to the row buffer (zero-copy on scans, copy when computed).

### Errors and codes

Mapped to existing ACE codes:

- `7200` AE_PARSE_ERROR
- `7201` AE_INVALID_SQL_TOKEN
- `5063` AE_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND
- `5066` AE_TABLE_NOT_FOUND
- `7041` AE_TYPE_MISMATCH
- `7042` AE_DIVISION_BY_ZERO
- and so on.

### Tests

- `sql_lexer_test.cpp`, `sql_parser_test.cpp` — grammar coverage.
- `sql_resolver_test.cpp` — name-binding edge cases.
- `sql_planner_test.cpp` — golden-file plans for canonical queries.
- `sql_optimizer_test.cpp` — verifies that rules fired (snapshot of the post-optimizer plan).
- `sql_executor_test.cpp` — end-to-end against fixtures with expected results.
- `aep_host_test.cpp` — a sample `.dll` / `.so` plugin returning fixed rows.
- `sql_conformance/` — Advantage SQL test suite derived from official ADS documentation samples.

## Error handling

### Internal model

Internal C++ code uses `Result<T>` (an `expected`-style type in `src/util/result.h`) so error paths are explicit and exceptions are reserved for true programming bugs (`assert`-equivalent contract violations).

```cpp
template<class T> using Result = std::expected<T, Error>;

struct Error {
    int32_t  code;        // ACE error code (e.g. 5012)
    int32_t  sub_code;    // OS errno / GetLastError when applicable
    std::string message;  // formatted, localised
    std::string context;  // file, table, recno, sql snippet
};
```

Errors propagate via early-return; no exception unwinding through L4.

### ACE error code surface

The L1 ABI returns the canonical `UNSIGNED32` ACE error code on every call. OpenADS reproduces the documented ranges so existing apps reading `AdsGetLastError` see identical numbers:

| Range | Family | Examples |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 4000–4999 | Transport / connection | `4001 AE_NETWORK_ERROR`, `4097 AE_INVALID_CONNECTION_HANDLE` |
| 5000–5999 | Engine / locking / records | `5012 AE_LOCKED`, `5036 AE_NO_CONNECTION`, `5063 AE_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND`, `5066 AE_TABLE_NOT_FOUND` |
| 6000–6999 | Index / order | `6105 AE_INDEX_NOT_FOUND`, `6106 AE_INDEX_CORRUPT` |
| 7000–7999 | SQL / parser / type | `7041 AE_TYPE_MISMATCH`, `7200 AE_PARSE_ERROR`, `7201 AE_INVALID_SQL_TOKEN` |

A canonical table lives in `src/abi/error_codes.h`, generated from the documented ACE constants. Anything not yet implemented returns `5004 AE_FUNCTION_NOT_AVAILABLE` rather than a fabricated code, so apps and `rddads` can degrade gracefully.

### `AdsGetLastError` semantics

ACE keeps a per-thread last-error slot. OpenADS replicates this:

```cpp
thread_local Error g_last_error;

extern "C" UNSIGNED32 AdsGetLastError(UNSIGNED32* pulErr,
                                      UNSIGNED8* pucBuf,
                                      UNSIGNED16* pusBufLen) {
    *pulErr = g_last_error.code;
    copy_text(pucBuf, pusBufLen, g_last_error.message);
    return AE_SUCCESS;
}
```

Every L1 thunk updates the slot before returning. Successful calls clear it.

### Localised messages

Default English. Optional catalogues for Spanish and Portuguese (large legacy ADS user bases). Selected via `AdsSetLocalizedMessages` or env `OPENADS_LOCALE=es`. Catalogues live in `src/abi/messages_<locale>.cpp`, lookup by `code`.

### Logging / tracing

Three levels controlled by env:

| Var | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| `OPENADS_LOG=info` | Connection open / close, table open, SQL executed (truncated) |
| `OPENADS_LOG=debug` | Plus index seeks, locks acquired, tx boundaries |
| `OPENADS_LOG=trace` | Every L1 entry / exit with arguments and return code |
| `OPENADS_LOG_FILE=<path>` | Redirect log; default `stderr` |

`tools/ace-trace` is a separate shim that intercepts every `Ads*` call and writes a structured trace; useful for diffing against original ACE behaviour.

### Failure boundaries

| Boundary | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| L5 (OS) errors | Map errno / `GetLastError` into `Error.sub_code`, surface a 4xxx or 5xxx ACE code |
| L4 corruption (CRC / LSN mismatch) | Halt access to the affected file, return `5103 AE_TABLE_CORRUPTED`, log details |
| L3 SQL errors | Return 7xxx range, no abort of the connection |
| L2 invalid handle | `4097 AE_INVALID_CONNECTION_HANDLE`, no crash |
| L1 panic (assert) | Last-resort: log and `abort()` only on contract violations during debug builds; release builds convert to `5000 AE_INTERNAL_ERROR` |

## Testing strategy and roadmap

### Test pyramid

| Layer | Tools | Coverage target |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Unit | doctest, run on every commit | ≥ 85 % per module (engine, drivers, sql, lock, tx) |
| Integration (in-process) | doctest, real files | Full driver matrix (ADT / CDX / NTX / VFP) × open / write / index / memo / tx |
| ABI conformance | C harness invoking L1 entry points | All ~230 ACE entry points exercised at least once |
| Harbour smoke | `harbour_smoke.prg` linked against `rddads` and OpenADS DLL | `tests/datad.prg`, `tests/manage.prg` from `c:\harbour\contrib\rddads\tests\` plus custom xBase scenarios |
| Byte compatibility | `tools/adt-dump`, `tools/cdx-dump` diff vs ACE-produced fixtures | All write paths produce byte-identical output |
| Multi-process | Two OpenADS plus optional original ACE on shared files | No corruption, lock semantics match |
| Fuzzing | libFuzzer over lexer / parser / log replay / driver readers | Zero crashes / UB after N hours |
| Benchmarks | google-benchmark micro-suite | No regression vs previous tag |
| Recovery | Crash-injection harness (`kill -9` between LSN boundaries) | Recovery converges deterministically |

### CI matrix

GitHub Actions:

- Compilers: MSVC 2022 (x86 / x64), GCC 11+, Clang 14+, MinGW-w64.
- OS: Windows 2022, Ubuntu 22.04, macOS 13, FreeBSD 14 (via cross / VM).
- Sanitisers: ASan, UBSan, TSan on Linux Clang job.
- Nightly: full Harbour rddads test suite plus byte-compat job against pinned ACE-produced fixtures.

## Next steps

Phase 1 is broken into nine independently shippable milestones (`M0`–`M8`). Each milestone gets its own implementation plan under `docs/superpowers/plans/`, written in TDD bite-sized form so any contributor can pick it up.

| Milestone | Plan | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **M0 — Skeleton** | [`2026-05-03-openads-m0-skeleton.md`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-03-openads-m0-skeleton.md) | **Done.** CMake project, L5 platform layer (file / lock / mmap / path / time / thread), `util/Result<T>` / `Span<T>` / `Log`, doctest harness (27 cases / 77 assertions), GitHub Actions matrix (Windows / Linux / macOS). |
| **M1 — DBF read (CDX)** | [`2026-05-03-openads-m1-dbf-read.md`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-03-openads-m1-dbf-read.md) | **Done.** Read-only DBF (`ADS_CDX` typed) via `AdsConnect60` / `AdsOpenTable` / `AdsGotoTop` / `AdsSkip` / `AdsGetField` and friends. No memo (M4), no index (M3), no write (M2). |
| **M2 — DBF write + LockMgr** | [`2026-05-03-openads-m2-dbf-write-lock.md`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-03-openads-m2-dbf-write-lock.md) | **Done.** Append / update / delete on CDX- and NTX-typed DBFs, `LockMgr` Compatible-mode byte ranges (NTX `1_000_000_000`, CDX `0x7FFFFFFE - recno`), single-process integrity tests. No pack / zap (M3), no memo (M4), no TPS (M5). |
| **M3 — Indexes** | [`2026-05-03-openads-m3-indexes.md`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-03-openads-m3-indexes.md) | **Partial — round-trips OpenADS-produced files only.** NTX header + leaf read+write+create works against indexes that OpenADS itself wrote. Multi-leaf NTX split, branch descent, and FoxPro CDX byte-compat are blocked by issues tracked in [`docs/known-issues.md`](docs/known-issues.md). Fixes land in **M3.6**. `Order` + `Scope` on `Table`, 15 ACE entry points, AOF/Pack/Zap stubs are all in place. |
| **M3.5 — CDX index** | (extends M3) | **Partial — non-standard byte layout.** A working compact-leaf encoder/decoder using a hardcoded 24/8/8-bit split. Round-trips OpenADS-produced `.cdx` files; **does NOT match FoxPro byte layout** (bit widths must derive from `keylen`, tag directory must use the compound structure tag). M3.6 replaces this with a real FoxPro-equivalent encoder driven by Harbour `hb_cdxPageLeafInitSpace`. See `docs/known-issues.md` items 1-3. |
| **M3.6 — Real index byte-compat** | (in flight) | **Partial.** **Done:** CDX leaf encoder now uses Harbour-equivalent `compute_layout()` modelled on `hb_cdxPageLeafInitSpace` (bBits derived from key length; for `keylen=4` the result is 18/3/3 bits packed in 3 bytes). Tightened `AdsOpenIndex` / `AdsCreateIndex` lifecycle (prior bindings cleared before `set_order`). `AdsCreateIndex` now skips deleted records. NTX `unique` and `descending` flags round-trip through create/reopen. **Pending:** CDX compound structure-tag directory, CDX big-endian branch descent at the right offset, NTX multi-level split, soft-seek past-end fix. See `docs/known-issues.md`. |
| **M4 — ADT + memo + VFP + AES** | [`2026-05-03-openads-m4-adt-memo-vfp-aes.md`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-03-openads-m4-adt-memo-vfp-aes.md) | **Partial.** **Done:** AES-128 / AES-256 ECB via vendored tiny-AES-c, validated against FIPS-197 Appendix B (AES-128) and NIST SP 800-38A F.1.5/F.1.6 (AES-256) test vectors. DBT memo real (dBase III/Clipper, 512-byte blocks, `0x1A 0x1A` terminator, multi-block walk). FPT memo real (FoxPro/VFP, big-endian header, 8-byte block headers, configurable block size 64/512). `Table::attach_memo` routes M-type field reads/writes through the memo store; `Connection::open_table` auto-attaches `.dbt` / `.fpt` siblings when M-fields are present. ABI thunks: `AdsGetMemoLength`, `AdsGetMemoDataType`, `AdsBinaryToFile`, `AdsFileToBinary` are live. `AdsGetLastAutoinc` returns 0 stub. Encryption ABI (`AdsEnableEncryption` / `AdsEncryptTable` / `AdsEncryptRecord` / etc.) returns `AE_FUNCTION_NOT_AVAILABLE` until a clean-room specification of the ADS record-level encryption layout is available (the AES primitive itself is ready). **Pending:** ADT format (proprietary; clean-room spec required), VFP driver autoinc/NULL bitmap extensions, ADM memo (same gating as ADT), AES record-encryption boundary on `Table`. |
| **M5 — TPS / WAL** | TBD | **Tx + WAL + crash recovery + savepoints landed.** ABI: `AdsBeginTransaction`, `AdsCommitTransaction`, `AdsRollbackTransaction`, `AdsInTransaction`, `AdsCreateSavepoint`, `AdsRollbackTransaction80`. Each tx event writes a record to `openads.txlog` in the data dir (`BEGIN` / `UPDATE` / `COMMIT` / `ABORT`, CRC-32C protected). UPDATE records carry the table relative path + before/after images. `Connection::open` runs recovery: any tx without `COMMIT` or `ABORT` is replayed by writing back before-images and appending `ABORT`, then the log is truncated. Savepoints are an in-memory ordered-op log layered on top of the before-image map; `AdsRollbackTransaction80` with a savepoint name does a partial rollback, with `nullptr` it falls back to a full rollback. Smoke tests cover crash mid-tx + recovery and partial rollback through a savepoint. **Pending:** group commit (batched fsync), page-LSN tracking with `.lsnmap` overlay for Compatible mode, savepoint persistence in WAL. |
| **M6 — Data Dictionary** | TBD | **Alias resolution landed (OpenADS-native DD format).** `engine::DataDict` is a UTF-8 text file (`# OpenADS Data Dictionary v0` + `TABLE alias=path` lines) created in the data dir. `Connection::open` accepts either a directory path or a `.add` path; in the latter case it loads the DD and auto-resolves aliases passed to `AdsOpenTable`. ABI: `AdsDDCreate`, `AdsDDAddTable`, `AdsDDRemoveTable`. Smoke covers create -> add -> open-by-alias -> reopen. **Pending:** proprietary `.add` binary format (deferred until a clean-room spec is available), users / groups / permissions, RI rules, views, stored procedures, validation expressions, default values. |
| **M7 — SQL engine** | TBD | **M7.5 landed (`SELECT *` + AND-joined `WHERE` with all six operators).** `engine::sql::parse_select` parses `SELECT * FROM <table> [WHERE <cmp> [AND <cmp>]*]` where each `<cmp>` is `<col> <op> '<literal>'` and `<op>` is one of `=`, `!=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`. `Table` gained a `RowPredicate` slot; `goto_top` / `skip` automatically advance past non-matching records when a filter is attached. ABI: `AdsExecuteSQLDirect` lowers each WHERE term into `(field_index, op, literal)` and the closure short-circuits the AND. Projection lists, OR / NOT / parens, numeric literals, ORDER BY, joins, aggregates, subqueries, and UDFs return `AE_PARSE_ERROR`. **Pending:** full Advantage SQL grammar (lexer + AST + planner + executor), xBase UDFs (LEFT, SUBSTR, CTOD, ...), AEP host for stored procedures, triggers, INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE / CREATE TABLE. |
| **M8 — Conformance + 0.1.0** | TBD | Full Harbour `tests/datad.prg` and `tests/manage.prg` green, byte-compat job green, multi-process scenario green, first tagged release. |

### Snapshot

- **135 doctest cases / 1820 assertions passing** on Windows / MSVC 2022 Release.
- **~80 ACE entry points wired** (read / write / lock / index / scope / memo / encryption / autoinc / transaction / savepoint / data dictionary / SQL).
- **Persistent WAL with crash recovery** is byte-identical for OpenADS-produced files.
- **Live tags:** `m0-done`, `m1-done`, `m2-done`, `m3-done`, `m3.5-done`, `m3.6-partial`, `m3.7-partial`, `m3.7-closed`, `m3.8-partial`, `m3.9-partial`, `m3.10-partial`, `m4-partial`, `m5-partial`, `m5.1-partial`, `m5.2-partial`, `m5.3-partial`, `m5.4-partial`, `m5.5-partial`, `m6-partial`, `m7.1-partial`, `m7.2-partial`, `m7.3-partial`, `m7.4-partial`, `m7.5-partial`, `m8.0-partial`, `m8.1-partial`, `m8.2-done`, `m8.3-done`, `m8.4-done`, `m8.5-done`, `m8.6-done`, `m8.7-partial`, `m8.8-done`, `m8.9-done`, `m8.10-done`, `m8.11-done`, `0.1.0-rc1`, `0.1.0`.
- **Drop-in DLL:** `ace64.dll` (Win x64) and `ace32.dll` (Win x86) build from the `openads_ace` SHARED target, exporting **226 `Ads*` entry points** plus 6 legacy MSVC2013-era CRT shims (`_dclass`, `_dsign`, `_wfsopen`, `_getch`, `_kbhit`, `_eof`) referenced by Harbour's prebuilt `msvc64` libs. 80 of the `Ads*` are real implementations (M0–M7); the rest are M8.1 stubs that return `AE_FUNCTION_NOT_AVAILABLE` (5004).
- **End-to-end Harbour validation (M8.3–M8.11):** `tests/harbour_smoke/smoke.prg` exercises the full read + write + index + multi-tag focus + transactions + memo path through `rddads.lib` and OpenADS' `ace64.dll`. See `tests/harbour_smoke/README.md` for captured outputs.

### Working on a milestone

1. Brainstorm the milestone briefly against the spec above to surface anything that changed since the original design was written.
2. Write its implementation plan into `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-openads-mN-<topic>.md` using the same TDD bite-sized template as M0.
3. Execute the plan task by task. Each task is `red → green → commit` and lands one focused change.
4. When the milestone is done, mark it green in the table above, push, and tag the head commit `mN-done` for traceability.

### Immediate next action

Execute `M0` using the saved plan. Two execution paths:

- **Subagent-driven (recommended).** Dispatch a fresh subagent per task with two-stage review between tasks. See `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`.
- **Inline.** Walk the plan in the current session with checkpoints. See `superpowers:executing-plans`.

## Build (M0 skeleton)

```
git clone https://github.com/FiveTechSoft/OpenADS.git
cd OpenADS
cmake --preset default
cmake --build build/default
ctest --preset default --output-on-failure
```

Other presets: `debug`, `msvc-x64`, `ninja-clang` — see `CMakePresets.json`.
