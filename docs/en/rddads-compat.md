# rddads / X# RDD compatibility

OpenADS' `ace64.dll` / `ace32.dll` is a **drop-in replacement** for
the Advantage Client Engine. Two third-party RDDs link against it
by name:

- **Harbour `contrib/rddads`** — covered end-to-end since
  v0.1.0-rc1 (the first Harbour smoke).
- **X#'s `AXDBFCDX` RDD** (`ADSRDD.prg`) — covered locally + over
  the wire since **v1.0.0-rc19** (M12.22 / M12.23).

This page documents the X# RDD work and is the canonical reference
for what each of the X#-specific exports actually does.

## How X# binds OpenADS

X# `ADSRDD.prg` performs `LoadLibrary("ace32.dll")` (or `ace64.dll`)
and resolves every entry point **by name** through
`GetProcAddress`. The X# Advantage RDD calls a much wider surface
than Harbour's `contrib/rddads`, including a set of versioned
overloads (`AdsCreateTable90`, `AdsCreateIndex90`, etc.) that exist
to absorb the charset / collation / page-size parameters newer ACE
builds added.

OpenADS therefore exports every `Ads*NN` name X# binds; most
forward to the base signature, a few are accept-and-ignore for
session / statement toggles that don't apply to a clean-room
implementation, and the genuinely-unimplemented return
`AE_FUNCTION_NOT_AVAILABLE` so the X# runtime falls back to its own
client path.

## M12.22 — versioned ACE overloads

| Export                          | Behaviour |
|---------------------------------|-----------|
| `AdsConnect26`                  | Forwards to `AdsConnect60`. |
| `AdsCreateTable71` / `AdsCreateTable90` | Forward to `AdsCreateTable` (drop charset / collation / page-size). |
| `AdsOpenTable90`                | Forwards to `AdsOpenTable80`. |
| `AdsCreateIndex90`              | Forwards to `AdsCreateIndex61` after re-mapping flags. |
| `AdsDDAddTable90`               | Forwards to `AdsDDAddTable`. |
| `AdsDDCreateRefIntegrity62`     | Forwards to `AdsDDCreateRefIntegrity`. |
| `AdsFindFirstTable62` / `AdsFindNextTable62` | Forward to base. |
| `AdsGetDateFormat60`            | Forwards to `AdsGetDateFormat`. |
| `AdsGetExact22`                 | Forwards to `AdsGetExact`. |
| `AdsReindex61`                  | Forwards to `AdsReindex`. |
| `AdsRestructureTable90`         | Forwards to `AdsRestructureTable`. |
| `AdsGetBookmark60` / `AdsGotoBookmark60` | Round-trip the recno as a 4-byte blob. |
| `AdsCancelUpdate90` / `AdsSetProperty90` | Accepted no-ops. |
| `AdsFindConnection25` / `AdsGetTableHandle25` | Report not-found — OpenADS keys by handle, not path / name. |

## M12.23 — the X# export gap

A live run of X#'s `AXDBFCDX` against OpenADS' DLL surfaced ~45
more entry points `ADSRDD.prg` binds by name. The behaviour:

- **Field setters** (`AdsSetField`, `AdsSetEmpty`, `AdsSetNull`,
  `AdsSetShort`, `AdsSetMoney`, `AdsSetTime`, `AdsSetTimeStamp`) —
  all handle the ACE "field name *or* 1-based ordinal cast to a
  pointer" idiom (X#'s `_FieldSub` calls `AdsGetFieldType` /
  `Length` / `Decimals` by ordinal, passing a tiny pointer value
  the old code dereferenced as a string).
- **Field readers** (`AdsGetDate`, `AdsGetMemoBlockSize`,
  `AdsGetTableOpenOptions`, `AdsGetBookmark`) — real
  implementations.
- **Cursor helpers** (`AdsCancelUpdate`, `AdsContinue`,
  `AdsEval*Expr`) — `AdsCancelUpdate` is an accept-and-ignore;
  the others return `AE_FUNCTION_NOT_AVAILABLE` so X# falls back.
- **RI / unique / autoinc enforcement toggles** —
  accept-and-ignore (the underlying enforcement still happens
  through `AdsCreateIndex` / DD).
- **`AdsStmt*` helpers** — return `AE_FUNCTION_NOT_AVAILABLE`;
  X#'s SQL surface routes around them.

## Semantics fixes that shipped with M12.23

These looked like "missing exports" from the X# RDD's point of
view, but were actually wrong behaviour in existing entries:

- **`AdsAppendRecord` auto-locks the new record.** ACE semantics
  for non-exclusive tables — X#'s `GoHot` refuses to write a
  record it sees as unlocked.
- **`AdsIsRecordLocked` / `AdsLockRecord` / `AdsUnlockRecord`
  honour `recno == 0` = current record** and report the real
  lock state instead of stubbing `0`.
- **`AdsCreateIndex61` / `AdsCreateIndex90` option-bit fix.** The
  "descending" flag is `ADS_DESCENDING` (`0x08`), not `0x02` —
  `0x02` is `ADS_COMPOUND`, which X#'s ADSRDD always sets for
  CDX orders, so the old mask built every X# order descending
  and `DbGoTop` landed on the last key.
- **`AdsCreateTable` / `AdsCreateTable90` stage an empty `.fpt`
  next to the `.dbf`** when the field list has an `M` field
  (using `usMemoBlockSize`, default 64). Without it
  `Connection::open_table` can't attach a memo store and any
  memo write fails "memo store not attached".

## Remote-server X# (M12.23, rc19)

Three more fixes so X#'s ADSRDD drives `openads_serverd` over the
wire (`AdsConnect60("tcp://host:port/<datadir>",
ADS_REMOTE_SERVER) → AX_SetConnectionHandle → DbUseArea`):

- `remote_field_index` honours the "field name OR 1-based ordinal
  cast to a pointer" idiom — same as the local side.
- The remote `AdsOpenTable` branch defaults a missing extension
  to `.dbf` (X# passes the bare table name for remote tables).
- `AdsGetTableFilename` gained a remote path (returning the
  opened name) instead of failing `AE_INTERNAL_ERROR` — X#'s
  `Open` calls it right after `_FieldSub`.

## Test harness

```
tests/smoke/xsharp/
├── AdsSmoke.prg          # local: ace64.dll directly
└── AdsSmoke_remote.prg   # remote: openads_serverd over tcp://
```

Both pass end-to-end against OpenADS:

- **Local smoke**: `DbCreate` (incl. an M field) → `DbUseArea` →
  `OrdCreate` ×2 → `DbAppend` + `FieldPut` ×4 → `DbCommit` →
  NAME-order `GoTop` / `Skip ±` / `GoBottom` / `Eof` →
  `DbSeek` hit + miss → memo round-trip → `DbDelete` /
  `DbRecall` → replace a key field + re-read through the CITY
  order → `DbCloseArea`.
- **Remote smoke**: opens `customer.dbf` on the server and does
  read / nav (`RecCount` / `GoTop` / `Skip ±` / `GoBottom` /
  `Eof` / `FieldGet`).

Doctest coverage: `tests/abi_versioned_overloads_test.cpp` (local)
and `tests/abi_remote_overloads_test.cpp` (over the wire, gated
on `-DOPENADS_TEST_REMOTE=ON`).

## Follow-ups landed in rc20+ from X# feedback

- **rc21 / M12.24** — `AdsGetLastTableUpdate` real signature
  matches ACE (`UNSIGNED8* pucDate, UNSIGNED16* pusLen`);
  `AdsSetDateFormat` is no longer a no-op; `AdsSetAOF` returns
  success + `ADS_OPTIMIZED_NONE` on non-optimisable expressions
  instead of error 7200.
- **rc22 / M12.25** — `AdsCreateTable` stamps today's date into
  the DBF header up front (matches ACE), so a fresh
  create+open reports today instead of `1900-00-00` until the
  first `DbAppend`.
