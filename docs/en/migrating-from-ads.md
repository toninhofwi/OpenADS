# Migrating from ADS

OpenADS is an open-source, ADS-compatible engine for applications built against
the Advantage Database Server (ADS) and the Advantage Client Engine (ACE) API.
If your data is DBF/ADT with CDX/NTX/ADI indexes and your app uses `rddads`,
the ACE C API, X#'s `AXDBFCDX`, or the PHP `advantage` extension, you can move
without rewriting it. This guide maps each piece of an Advantage install to its
OpenADS counterpart.

## Concept map

| Advantage | OpenADS | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Advantage Database Server (service) | `openads_serverd` | TCP server; installs as a Windows Service / Linux systemd / macOS launchd. |
| Advantage Local Server | the engine DLL itself | `ace64.dll` runs the engine in-process; no separate `adsloc` DLL. |
| `ace32.dll` / `ace64.dll` (client) | `ace64.dll` / `ace32.dll` (drop-in) | Same name, same C ABI. Also shipped as `openace64.dll` for side-by-side installs. |
| Advantage Data Architect (ARC) | **Studio** web console | Browser UI: tables, SQL, structure, data dictionary. Launch with `openads-studio.bat`/`.sh`. |
| `ads.cfg` / server settings | `openads.ini` | Written by `openads_serverd --setup`, read with `--config`. |
| Data dictionary `.add` / `.ai` | same `.add` / `.ai` | Opened and managed natively. |
| Connection path `\\srv\vol\data` | `tcp://srv:6262/data` | Remote URI; local stays a filesystem path. |
| Default TCP port **6262** | **6262** | Identical, so keep it — unless ADS still runs on the same host (see below). |

## Server side — install like the old setup did

The old ADS installer asked for a port, a data folder, a code page and whether
to start as a service. OpenADS does the same through a console wizard:

```
openads_serverd --setup
```

It writes an `openads.ini` and, if you ask it to, registers the auto-start
service for your platform. Run it later straight from that file:

```
openads_serverd --config openads.ini
```

> **Running OpenADS and ADS on the same machine?** Both default to TCP 6262.
> Either stop the Advantage service first, or give OpenADS another port
> (`port = 6263` in the ini, or `--port 6263`). The server prints a clear hint
> if the bind clashes.

> **Code page.** OpenADS serves UTF-8 / CP437 today; a selectable server code
> page (CP850, Windows-1252) is on the roadmap. If your DBFs are CP850, test a
> copy before going live.

## Client side — point your app at OpenADS

You do **not** relink for the common case:

1. Put **`ace64.dll`** (32-bit app → `ace32.dll`) next to your `.exe`, or on the
   `PATH` ahead of any existing copy.
2. Run the app. `rddads` / FiveWin / xBase++ binaries that load Advantage by the
   canonical name now use OpenADS unchanged.

If you link a fresh build, use the import lib for your compiler under `lib/`
(MSVC, MinGW, Borland). Ordinal-linked legacy binaries: see
[`ordinal-compat.md`](ordinal-compat.md). RDD specifics:
[`rddads-compat.md`](rddads-compat.md).

Remote connections use a URI in place of a UNC path:

```c
AdsConnect60("tcp://dbhost:6262/apps/sales/sales.add",
             user, pass, ADS_REMOTE_SERVER, &hConn);
```

Other clients: the PHP extension mirrors the old `php_advantage` API
(`bindings/php_ext/`), and a portable FFI binding is in `bindings/php/`.

## Administering data — use Studio instead of ARC

Run `openads-studio.bat` (Windows) or `./openads-studio.sh` (Linux/macOS) from
the release folder, or, on a running server, start it with
`--http-port 6263` and open `http://SERVER:6263/`. Studio covers what you did in
ARC: browse and edit rows, run SQL, view/rebuild structure (reindex, pack, zap),
and create/edit data-dictionary objects (tables, users, indexes, RI rules).
Secure it with `--http-user user:password`; for public exposure put a TLS proxy
in front (see [`tls-deployment.md`](tls-deployment.md)).

## Checklist

- [ ] Install the server: `openads_serverd --setup` → `openads.ini`.
- [ ] Resolve the 6262 port if ADS still runs on the host.
- [ ] Drop `ace64.dll`/`ace32.dll` next to your app (or relink with `lib/`).
- [ ] Smoke-test reads/writes/index seeks against a **copy** of the data.
- [ ] Verify accented text (code-page caveat above).
- [ ] Use Studio (`openads-studio`) for day-to-day admin.
- [ ] Set up auto-start (wizard, or [`service-deployment.md`](service-deployment.md)).
