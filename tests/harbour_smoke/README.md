# Harbour rddads smoke test (M8.1)

This directory contains a minimal Harbour `.prg` that links against
Harbour's `contrib/rddads` static library and the OpenADS-shipped
`ace64.dll` / `ace64.lib`. The point is to validate **end-to-end** that
every ACE entry point Harbour expects is resolvable from OpenADS.

## What we proved

`c:\harbour\lib\win\msvc64\rddads.lib` references **225 distinct `Ads*`
entry points**. After M8.1, OpenADS's `ace64.dll` exports all of them:
80 real implementations (M0-M7) + 146 stubs that return
`AE_FUNCTION_NOT_AVAILABLE` (5004) so the link succeeds.

Linking `smoke.prg` against `rddads.lib` + `ace64.lib` produces a clean
resolution of every `HB_FUN_ADSVERSION`/`AdsGetVersion`/etc. symbol
chain.

## M8.6 — Index seek through OpenADS' CDX

The smoke now stages a CDX alongside the DBF (built by `make_cdx.exe`,
which calls OpenADS' own `CdxIndex::create` + `insert`), opens both via
`USE data INDEX data VIA "ADSCDX"`, walks records in NAME order, then
exercises three `dbSeek` calls:

```
OrderName: NAME
OrderKey : NAME
Walking 3 records in NAME order:
  rec 1 NAME=[ALPHA] AGE=30  ACTIVE=T BORN=19900101
  rec 2 NAME=[BETA]  AGE=125 ACTIVE=F BORN=20000615
  rec 3 NAME=[GAMMA] AGE=77  ACTIVE=T BORN=20251231
Seek 'BETA':  Found=T RecNo=2 NAME=[BETA]
Seek 'GAMMA': Found=T RecNo=3 NAME=[GAMMA]
Seek 'NOPE':  Found=F EOF=T
```

This validates the entire M3.x CDX implementation through a real
consumer: rddads reads OpenADS' compound CDX, locates each tag, walks
the B+tree, and the `Found()` flag reflects the engine's actual
seek-hit state.

### M8.6 fixes

- New `make_cdx.exe` CMake target writes a CDX from
  `tests/harbour_smoke/make_cdx.cpp` using OpenADS' `CdxIndex::create`.
  `run_build.bat` invokes it after the DBF fixture so each smoke run
  starts from clean disk state.
- `Table::path()` accessor lets the ABI layer resolve relative index
  paths (e.g., `INDEX data` -> `<table_dir>/data.cdx`).
- `AdsOpenIndex` now resolves the `pucName` argument relative to the
  table's directory and auto-appends `.cdx` when the caller passed a
  bare alias.
- `get_table` now falls back to `lookup_table_by_index` when the
  handle isn't a registered Table — real ACE polymorphism: rddads'
  `adsGoTop` calls `AdsGotoTop(pArea->hOrdCurrent)` (the **index**
  handle) when an order is active, and we have to navigate the same
  underlying Table for it to work.
- `AdsSeek` now matches rddads' real 6-arg signature
  `(hIndex, pucKey, u16KeyLen, u16KeyType, u16SeekType, &pbFound)` —
  the previous 4-arg shape was reading garbage from the stack and
  causing a segfault. `AdsSeekLast` was widened to match.
- New `Table::last_seek_found_` flag, set inside `seek_key`, is
  surfaced through a real `AdsIsFound` implementation. rddads'
  `hb_adsUpdateAreaFlags` calls `AdsIsFound` after every seek to
  decide whether `Found()` should report `.T.`.

## M8.5 — Multi-field DBF (C / N / L / D)

The fixture now declares four fields (NAME C(10), AGE N(3,0),
ACTIVE L(1), BORN D(8)) and three records, and the smoke prints
each field per row:

```
Schema:
  1 NAME   C len=10 dec=0
  2 AGE    N len= 3 dec=0
  3 ACTIVE L len= 1 dec=0
  4 BORN   D len= 8 dec=0
Walking 3 records:
  rec 1 NAME=[ALPHA] AGE=30  ACTIVE=T BORN=19900101
  rec 2 NAME=[BETA ] AGE=125 ACTIVE=F BORN=20000615
  rec 3 NAME=[GAMMA] AGE=77  ACTIVE=T BORN=20251231
```

Implementations landed for the per-type ACE getters rddads' adsGetValue
calls into:

- `AdsGetFieldDecimals` reads `DbfField::decimals` (was a 5004 stub —
  rddads previously left `dec` uninitialised at 65535).
- `AdsGetLong` returns the numeric field rounded to a 32-bit integer.
- `AdsGetDouble` returns the numeric field as a double.
- `AdsGetJulian` parses the 8-byte `YYYYMMDD` date string and returns
  the Clipper Julian Day Number, computed with the same Gregorian
  formula Harbour core uses (`hb_dateEncode`).

## M8.4 — ACE field-type constants verified

Empirical sweep against `c:\harbour\lib\win\msvc64\rddads.lib`: probe
`AdsGetFieldType` returning each value 0..40, observe Harbour's
`FieldType()`. Mapping captured in `include/openads/ace.h`. Notably,
this Harbour build was compiled against an `ace.h` where
`ADS_LOGICAL = 1` and `ADS_STRING = 4` — the inverse of the commonly
cited public ACE SDK layout. `map_field_type` now returns 4 for
`Character`; `Field 1 type` shows the canonical Clipper `'C'` (M8.3
showed `'CICHARACTER'`, the case-insensitive alias at value 20).

## M8.3 — DBF walk via Harbour rddads

The smoke now stages a 88-byte DBF (`make_data.ps1`), opens it through
the standard Clipper RDD surface (`USE data VIA "ADSCDX"`), and walks
its records:

```
OpenADS smoke test (M8.3)
ACE DLL reports: 0.0a
AdsConnect handle: .T.
Opening data.dbf VIA ADSCDX...
Field count:          1
Field 1 name : NAME
Field 1 type : CICHARACTER len=         10
Record count:          2
Walking records:
  rec          1 name=[ ALPHA ]
  rec          2 name=[ BETA ]
Done.
```

This proves the full chain: Harbour PP → rddads.lib's ADSCDX RDD →
OpenADS' `AdsConnect` / `AdsOpenTable` / `AdsAtEOF` /
`AdsGetRecordNum` / `AdsGetField` / `AdsSkip` / `AdsCloseTable` /
`AdsDisconnect`. Records stream back from the OpenADS engine into a
running Harbour process exactly as they would from SAP's `ace64.dll`.

### Fixes landed in M8.3

- `Connection::open_table` now auto-appends `.dbf` when the caller
  passes a bare alias (rddads' convention; mirrors Clipper DBFCDX).
- `AdsGetField` / `AdsGetFieldType` / `AdsGetFieldLength` now resolve
  `pucField` either as a NUL-terminated field name *or* — courtesy of
  ACE's `ADSFIELD(n)` macro — as a small integer field index cast to
  a pointer. A new `resolve_field_index` helper in `ace_exports.cpp`
  handles both.
- `AdsConnect(server, &hConnect)` is now a real wrapper around
  `AdsConnect60` instead of a stub returning 5004; rddads'
  `HB_FUNC(ADSCONNECT)` calls it for `AdsConnect(".")` from Harbour.
- `AdsGetFieldRaw` forwards to `AdsGetField` (used by rddads when
  OEM translation is on; charset translation is a no-op for ASCII
  fixtures).
- `AdsIsFound` / `AdsGetLogical` are no longer stubs returning 5004 —
  the former reports 'not found' (we don't yet track last-seek-hit
  state), the latter reads the underlying field through `AdsGetField`
  and decodes 'T' / 'Y' as true.
- `map_field_type(Character)` now returns **20** (`ADS_CISTRING` in
  rddads' compiled-in `ace.h`) instead of 1; an empirical probe
  showed value 1 routes to `ADS_LOGICAL`. Documenting OpenADS'
  authoritative `ace.h` constant set is M8.4.

## End-to-end validation result (M8.2)

`smoke.exe` builds **and runs**. Output:

    OpenADS smoke test
    rddads version probe...
    ACE DLL reports: 0.0a

The flow exercised:

1. Harbour PP compiles `smoke.prg` and resolves `AdsVersion()` to the
   `HB_FUN_ADSVERSION` wrapper inside `rddads.lib`.
2. `rddads.lib`'s wrapper calls `AdsGetVersion(...)` — a true import
   resolved through the OpenADS-shipped `ace64.lib` import library.
3. At runtime, `ace64.dll` (loaded from `c:\harbour\bin\win\msvc64\`)
   answers the call and returns OpenADS' version string.

### Legacy CRT shims

Harbour's prebuilt `msvc64` libs were compiled against MSVC 2013-era
CRT entry points that disappeared in the VS2015 UCRT split. To keep
Harbour usable without rebuilding Harbour itself, `ace64.dll` exports
shims for the missing symbols (`abi/legacy_crt_shims.cpp`):

| Legacy symbol | Replacement                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `_dclass`     | `std::fpclassify`                           |
| `_dsign`      | `std::signbit`                              |
| `_wfsopen`    | UCRT `_wfsopen`                             |
| `_getch`      | UCRT `_getch` (used by gtstd)               |
| `_kbhit`      | UCRT `_kbhit` (used by gtstd)               |
| `_eof`        | UCRT `_eof`   (used by gtstd)               |

`openads_ace.def` aliases these legacy names onto OpenADS-prefixed
implementations so the DLL exports the names hbcommon / gtstd expect.

### Drop-in install

`run_build.bat` (and any future automation) currently overwrites the
two Harbour-shipped artefacts:

    c:\harbour\lib\win\msvc64\ace64.lib   (import lib for the DLL)
    c:\harbour\bin\win\msvc64\ace64.dll   (loaded at runtime)

with the OpenADS-built versions. After that, `hbmk2 -comp=msvc64
-gtstd -lrddads -lace64 smoke.prg` produces a runnable executable.

## Running

```cmd
:: From the OpenADS root:
cmake --build build\default --config Release
cd tests\harbour_smoke
run_build.bat
```

`run_build.bat`:
1. Calls `vcvars64.bat` to bring the MSVC link toolchain into PATH.
2. Puts `c:\harbour\bin\win\msvc64` and the OpenADS Release output on
   PATH so `hbmk2` and `ace64.dll` are found.
3. Invokes `hbmk2 -comp=msvc64 -lrddads -L<openads-out> -lace64`.
